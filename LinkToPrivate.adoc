[small]#The “public version” has not been revised since August 2025 to provide students who are not in my classes with a stable experience of the textbook throughout the academic year. However, as an instructor you may want to review the changes to the chapters link:./CSC230/relations.html[Relations,] link:./CSC230/induction.html[Proofs: Mathematical Induction,] and link:./CSC230/trees.html[Trees] in the “CSC230 version” in case those changes would be useful to your students. Be warned that _all chapters_ of the “CSC230 version” are likely to be revised during the Winter 2026/Spring 2026 semester.#
