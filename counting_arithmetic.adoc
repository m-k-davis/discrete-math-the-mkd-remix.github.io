Many of us learned how to count when we were young children. We may have counted up to 10 on our fingers, or up to 20 on our fingers and toes, but we probably never counted up to much more than 100. However, many problems in computer science or mathematics require that we count the number of elements of sets that contain millions or billions of elements, or even more. 

This chapter introduces techniques for counting the number of elements of a set. These techniques can be used quickly and efficiently no matter the size of the set.


== Some Foundational Counting Principles

Each of the four arithmetic operations corresponds to a rule we can use to count quickly. 

=== The Sum Rule

The *sum rule,* also called the *addition principle,* describes the number of possible choices of one element from a union of two sets that share no common elements. 

.The Sum Rule
****
Suppose that we have a procedure that consists of completing one step, and that the step can be chosen from either a first set of _j_ possible ways to complete the step or from a second set of _k_ possible ways to complete the step, and that no way of completing the step is in both the first and second sets. Then there are $j+k$ ways to complete the procedure. 
****

This is called the sum rule for counting because it involves adding to find a total. The sum rule can also be extended to more than two sets, as long as every pair of the sets have no elements in common.



****
.Example {counter:countexample}
A student in a Capstone course can choose a project from three different professors. The professors have 3, 7, and 4 possible projects, and no project is on more than one professor's list. How many possible projects can the student choose?

.Solution
The student can pick out a project by choosing from the first professor, the second professor, or the third professor. Since no project is on more than
one list, the sum rules says that there are $3 + 7 + 4 = 14$ projects to choose from.

=== The Subtraction Rule

The *subtraction rule* is a special case of the *inclusion-exclusion principle* applied to two sets. The subtdescribes the number of possible choices of one element from a union of two sets that do share one or more common elements. 

.The Subtraction Rule
****
Suppose that we have a procedure that consists of completing one step, and that the step can be chosen from either a first set of _j_ possible ways to complete the step or from a second set of _k_ possible ways to complete the step, but that there are _m_ possible ways of completing the step that are in both the first and second sets. Then there are $j+k-m$ ways to complete the procedure. 
****

The subtraction rule is a special case of the *inclusion-exclusion principle* that involves only two sets. The inclusion-exclusion principle is discussed in more detail in the link:./set_theory.html[Set Theory] and link:./[Proofs: Mathematical Induction] chapters.

.Example {counter:countexample}
In a group of students, 17 are majoring in computer science, 13 are majoring in mathematics, and 6 are majoring in both computer science and mathematics. +  
How many students are in the group?

.Solution
There are 17 students majoring in computer science, but 6 of these students are majoring in both computer science and mathematics. Likewise, there are 13 students majoring in mathematics, but 6 of these students are majoring in both computer science and mathematics. + 
If we applied the addition rule to compute $17+13 = 30$, this would be incorrect because the 6 students who are majoring in both computer science and mathematics are counted _twice,_ once as a computer science major and then again as a mathematics major. We can repair the count by subtracting 6 from the sum of 17 and 13; this will count each of the students exactly once. That is, the number of students in the group is $17+13-6=24.$  
****
////

****
.Example {counter:countexample}
In a group of students, 17 are enrolled in discrete mathematics, 13 are enrolled in probability, and 6 are enrolled in both discrete mathematics and probability. +  
How many students are in the group?

.Solution
There are 17 students enrolled in discrete mathematics, but 6 of these students are enrolled in both discrete mathematics and probability. Likewise, there are 13 enrolled in probability, but 6 of these students are enrolled in both discrete mathematics and probability. + 
If we applied the addition rule by computing $17+13 = 30$, this counts the 6 students who are enrolled in both discrete mathematics and probability  _twice,_ once as a student enrolled in discrete mathematics and then again as a student enrolled in probability. We can repair the count by subtracting 6 from the sum of 17 and 13; this will count each of the students exactly once. That is, the number of students in the group is $17+13-6=24.$  + 
[small]#As an alternative, we could subtract 6 from each of 17 and 13 to get three disjoint sets of students: The $17-6=11$ who are are enrolled in discrete mathematics but not probability, the $13-6=7$ who are enrolled in both discrete mathematics and probability, and the 6 who are enrolled in both discrete mathematics and probability. Notice that we can now add $(17-6)+(13-6)+6 = 24$, which is the correct count. Also note that $(17-6)+(13-6)+6 = 17+(-6)+13+(-6)+6 = 17 + 13 -6,#
****

.Example {counter:countexample}
// MKD change context??
A tech company has 200 applicants for a position. Of the applicants, 150 of  were computer science majors, 43 were business majors, and 25 were double majors in computer science and business. + 
How many applicants did not major in either computer science or business?

.Solution
By the subtraction rule, there are $150 + 43 - 25 = 168$ applicants that majored in computer science or business (or both). The number of applicants who did not major in either computer science or business is $200 - 168 = 32.$
****

****
.Example {counter:countexample}
How many bit strings of length four start with 1 or end with 00?

.Solution
A bit string of length four that starts with 1 will be of the form $1~*~*~*$. For each $*$ there are two choices, 0 or 1, so by the product rule, there are $2^3$ bit strings of this form. A bit string of length four that ends with 00 will be of the form $*~*~0~0$, so there are $2^2$ bit strings of this form.
Finally,
a bit string of length four that starts with 1 and ends with 00 will be of the form $1~*~0~0$, so there are 2 bit strings of this form. By the subtraction rule
there are $2^3 + 2^2 - 2 = 8+4-2=10$ possibilities.

=== The Product Rule

To find the total number of outcomes for two or more successive events where both events must occur, multiply the number of outcomes for each event together.  For instance, if you want to find the number of outcomes possible when you roll a die and toss a coin, you could use the product rule. It is important to note that the events must be independent, meaning one doesn't effect the other.

.The Product Rule
****
Suppose that we have a procedure that consists of completing two steps, that there are _k_ possible ways to complete the first step, and for each possible way of completing the first step, there are _m_ possible ways to complete the second step. Then there are _k⋅m_ ways to complete the procedure. 
****

The product rule also called the *multiplication principle.*

// MKD verify this next example: Is it P(n,r) or C(n,r) as it is worded?? 
// Think it's got to be C(n,r)

.Solution
The first employee has 7 offices to choose from, the second has 6 offices to choose from, the third can choose from 5, and the fourth can choose from 4. By the
product rule, there are $7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 = 840$ ways to assign the offices.

=== The Division Rule


//MKD next paragraph is liftere from Rosen - replace
Remark: The division rule comes in handy when it appears that a task can be done in n different ways, but it turns out that for each way of doing 
the task, there are d equivalent ways of doing it. Under these circumstances, we can conclude that there are n∕d inequivalent ways of doing
the task.

.The Division Rule
****
Suppose a task can be done using a procedure that can be carried out in $n$ ways, and for every way w, exactly $d$ of the $n$ ways correspond to way w.
Then there are $\frac{n}{d}$ ways to do the task.

== The Pigeonhole Principle

A suprising number of counting problems can be solved with the so-called pigeonhole principle.

.Pigeonhole Principle
****
If $k+1$ pigeons are roosting in $k$ pigeonholes then at least one pigeonhole contains more than one pigeon.

== Permutations and Combinations


//MKD added subsection header and text

Many counting problems involve choosing, from a set of $n$ objects, either an ordered sequence of $r$ objects or a subset of $r$ objects, with no repetition allowed. We will describe ways to do this type of counting in this section.

=== Permutations

// MKD rewrote this paragraph
//Consider the first four letters of the alphabet, $A, B, C, D$. A //*permutation* of these letters would be an arrangement of them in //different orders.

A *permutation* of a set of elements is an ordered arrangement of the elements 
//MKD added
without repetition of elements 
. 
// MKD added
A permutation may involve every element of the set, or only some of the elements of the set.

//MKD Aug 20 2024
// rewrote to avoid capital C since this clashed with C(n,r) later
Consider the last four letters of the English alphabet, $W, X, Y, Z$.

* $WXYZ, XWYZ, WXZY$ are permutations of the letters taken four at a time
* $XZW, WXY, WXZ$ are permutations of the letters taken three at a time
* $WX, WY, ZX$ are permutations of the letters taken two at a time

Notice that no letter is repeated in a permutation.

// MKD added the following paragraph
By listing all possible permutations of $W, X, Y, Z$, we can determine that 
there are 24 permutations of the letters taken four at a time, 
24 permutations of the letters taken three at a time, 
and 6 permutations of the letters taken three at a time. 
But what if we wanted to find all the possible permutations of the twenty six letters $A, B, \ldots , W, X, Y, Z$? It is very time consuming to write out all possible permutations of the twenty six letters taken, say, twenty one at a time, so we will develop a method and formula for doing this.

//MKD considered changing $r$-permutation to _r-_permutation but it does not look as good
In general, given a set of $n$ objects, an _ordered arrangment_ of $r \le n$ of 
//them 
the objects is called an *$r$-permutation*  or a *permutation of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time*. We 
//will denote this by 
use the notation 
$P(n,r)$ to represent the number of permutations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time. Note that $_nP_r$ is 
//a 
another commonly used notation, especially on calculators.

//MKD added the following two paragraphs
Suppose we have $n$ objects and want to construct a $2$-permutation of the objects. There are $n$ possible choices for the first object, and once that object is chosen, there are $n-1$ possible choices for the second object. 
We now use the product rule to conclude that there are $n(n-1)$ ways to choose the two objects; note that the order of the choices matters here.

We can generalize this argument, informally, as follows: Suppose we have $n$ objects and want to construct an $r$-permutation, where $r \le n.$ There are $n$ possible choices for the first object, $n-1$ possible choices for the second object, and so on, until we have $n-(r-1)$ possible choices for the $r\text{th}$ object. Apply the product rule repeatedly to find that there are $ n(n-1)\cdots (n-r+1)$ $r$-permutations of the $n$ objects. 

.Theorem
****
$P(n,r) = n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-r+1)$
// = \displaystyle \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$.
****

// MKD - added text - maybe add an exercise for the induction, too?
Note that a formal proof can be done by using mathematical induction.
// on $r$, treating $n$ as a constant.

.Example {counter:countexample}

If there are 10 runners in a race, how many different ways can the gold, silver, and bronze medals be awarded?

.Solution
There are 10 objects (the runners) and we are choosing 3 to win medals. So the number of ways they can be awarded is


$P(10,3) = \displaystyle \frac{10!}{(10-3)!} = \frac{10!}{7!} = 10 \times 9 \times 8 = 720$

Alternatively, we could have used the product rule and noticed that there are 10 ways to award the gold, then there are 9 ways to award the silver,
then 8 ways to award the brozne.

How many permutations of the digits 0123456789 are there that contain the string 456?

.Solution
We can regard this as a permutation of 8 objects: the string 456 and the other 7 digits. Since they can occur in any order, the number of permutations is

$P(8,8) = 8! = 40320.$

//MKD added subsection header 

=== Combinations

A selection 
of objects from a set of $n$ objects 
where order 
of selection 
does not matter is called a *combination*. 
Notice that each combination corresponds to a subset of the set of $n$ objects.
//, that is, each combination is the unordered list that describes a subset.

Consider the letters $W, X, Y, Z$ and choose three at a time where the order does not matter. 
//That is, the choice $ABC$ is the same choice as $BCA$.  
//MKD inserted sentences
In this case we are selecting a _subset_ of size three instead of a sequence of length three. The sets $\{ W, X, Y \}$ and $\{ X, Y, W \}$ are just two ways of describing the same set since the order in which elements of a set are listed does not matter.  

* There are four possible ways to choose three letters without regard to order:
$\{ W, X, Y \}$, 
$\{ W, X, Z \}$, 
$\{ W, Y, Z \}$, and 
$\{ X, Y, Z \}$.
* There are six possible ways to choose three letters without regard to order:
$\{ W, X \}$, 
$\{ W, Y \}$, 
$\{ W, Z \}$, 
$\{ X, Y \}$, 
$\{ X, Z \}$, and 
$\{ Y, Z \}$. 
* There are four possible ways to choose one letter (without regard to order):
$\{ Z \}$, 
$\{ Y \}$, 
$\{ X \}$, and 
$\{ W \}$. (Keep reading to find out why this "reversed" ordering of the subsets was used.)


This shows that there are 
4 combinations of 4 objects taken 3 at a time,  
6 combinations of 4 objects taken 2 at a time, and 
4 combinations of 4 objects taken 1 at a time.  


In general, given a set of $n$ objects, 
an 
_unordered selection_ of $r\le n$ of them is 
called 
an *$r$-combination* or a *combination of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time*. We will denote this by $C(n,r)$, read as 
"$n$ choose $r$." 
Note that $_nC_r$ is commonly used by calculators. 
Another common notation is ${n}\choose{r}$. 


Using this notation, we can write $C(4,3) = 4$, $C(4,2) = 6$, and $C(4,1) = 4$.


Notice that $C(4,3) = C(4,1)$; it may appear that this "just happens to be true", but in fact is an example of the next theorem. In this case, a combination of 4 objects taken 3 at a time corresponds to a combination of 4 objects taken 1 at a time - we can choose 3 of the 4 elements by "throwing out" the 1 element we don't want to keep. That is, we choose the 3-element subset we care about indirectly by instead choosing the 1-element complement of the subset.

In general, there is always a one-to-one correspondence between 
the combinations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time and the combinations of $n$ objects taken $n-r$ at a time: Choosing $r$ elements for a subset corresponds to choosing the $n-r$ elements for the complement of the subset. 

// MKD - need to add this to set theory chapter after May 24, 2024:
// The one-to-one correspondence on power set that maps A to its complement.

.Theorem
****
$C(n,r) = C(n,n-r)$
****

A formal proof of the theorem can be written by proving that, for any set $S$, the function with domain and codomain $\mathcal{P}(S)$ and that maps each subset of $S$ to its complement is both injective and surjective.


//MKD added the following two paragraphs
Next, notice that every $r$-combination corresponds to $P(r, r) = r!$ different $r$-permutations. That is, to select a $r$-permutation we could instead first select a $r$-combination without regard to order and then order the $r$ elements. 

As an example, suppose we have $n$ objects and want to construct a $3$-permutation. We could instead first choose a $3$-combination of the objects. There are $C(n,3)$ possible $3$-combinations. Once we have chosen a specific $3$-combination, we can reorder the 3 elements 
//in the subset of 3 elements 
in $P(3,3) = 3!$ ways. 
This argument shows that 
$P(n,3) = C(n,3) \cdot P(3,3) =  C(n,3) \cdot 3!$, so 
$C(n,3) = \displaystyle \frac{P(n,3)}{3!}$. 

We can generalize this argument for each natural number $r \leq n$ to arrive at the next theoren.

.Theorem
****
$C(n,r) = \displaystyle \frac{P(n,r)}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
****

// MKD - added text - maybe add an exercise for the induction, too?
A formal proof of the theorem can be done by using mathematical induction.
// on $r$, treating $n$ as a constant.

== The Binomial Theorem

An algebraic expression of that is the product of a number and power of zero or more variables is called a *term.* Two terms are called *like terms* if the two terms have the exact same variables and those variables appear with the exact same exponents. For example, $a,$ $ab,$ $5a,$ and $3a^{2}$ are terms, and $a$ and $5a$ are like terms. Like terms can be added to make a new term, for example, $a + 5a$ is $6a$ where we've used the distributive property of multiplication over addition to write \[ a + 5a = 1a + 5a = (1+5)a = 6a \] 

Now consider the product of two algebraic expressions $a+b$ and $x+y$ where the variables represent real numbers. We can rewrite $(a+b)(x+y)$ in an expanded form by using the distributive property of multiplication over addition: \[ (a+b)(x+y) = a(x+y) + b(x+y) = ax + ay + bx + by. \]

Another way to view this multiplication is as follows: You need to sum all the possible products you can form by choosing a first factor from the set $\{ a, \, b \}$ and a second factor from the set $\{ x, \, y \}.$ Apply the multiplication rule to compute that there must be $(2)(2) = 4$ possible products, namely, $ax,$ $ay,$ $bx,$ and $by.$ In this way, we can calculate the same result, \[ (a+b)(x+y) = ax + ay + bx + by. \]


In case both factors are $(a+b)$, we get \[ (a+b)(a+b) = a(a+b) + b(a+b) = aa + ab + ba + bb = a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2}. \]

Notice that the coefficients can be thought of as the number of ways to choose $b$ for each term during the multiplication: \[  a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2} = C(2,0)a^{2} + C(2,1)ab + C(2,2)b^{2} = {2\choose0}a^{2} + {2\choose1}ab + {2\choose2}b^{2}. \]

Note that this can be written as \[ \left( C(1,0)a + C(1,1)b \right)^{2} = C(2,0)a^{2} + C(2,1)ab + C(2,2)b^{2} \] or \[ \left( {1\choose0}a + {1\choose1}b \right)^{2} = {2\choose0}a^{2} + {2\choose1}ab + {2\choose2}b^{2}. \]

This gives us \[ C(1,0)^{2} a^{2} + C(1,0)C(1,1) ab +C(1,1)C(1,0) ab + C(1,1)^{2} b^{2} = C(2,0) a^{2} + C(2,1) ab + C(2,2) b^{2} \] or \[ {1\choose0}^{2} a^{2} + {1\choose0} {1\choose1} ab +{1\choose1} {1\choose0} ab + {1\choose1}^{2 }b^{2} = {2\choose0}a^{2} + {2\choose1}ab + {2\choose2}b^{2}. \]

Look at the next highest power: \[ (a+b)(a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2}) = a(a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2}) + b(a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2}) = a^{3} + 2a^{2} b + ab^{2} + a^{2} b + 2ab^{2} + b^{3} = (1)a^{3} + (2+1) a^{2} b + (1+2)ab^{2}) +(1)b^{3} \]

Note that \[ (a+b)^{n} = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} {n\choose i} a^{n-i} b^{i} \]  


\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
(a+b)(a+b) {} & = a (a+b) + b (a+b))  \\ 
& = a^{2} + a b + b a + b^{2}  \\
& = (1)a^{2} + (1+1) a b + (1) b^{2} \\ 
& = a^{2} + 2 a b + b^{2}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
(a+b) \left( a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2} \right) {} & = a \left( a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2} \right) + b \left( a^{2} + 2ab + b^{2} \right)  \\ 
& = a^{3} + 2a^{2} b + ab^{2} + a^{2} b + 2ab^{2} + b^{3}  \\
& = (1)a^{3} + (2+1) a^{2} b + (1+2) ab^{2} +(1) b^{3} \\ 
& = a^{3} + 3 a^{2} b + 3 ab^{2} + b^{3}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
(a+b) \left( a^{3} + 3 a^{2} b + 3 ab^{2} + b^{3} \right) {} & = a \left( a^{3} + 3 a^{2} b + 3 ab^{2} + b^{3} \right) + b \left( a^{3} + 3 a^{2} b + 3 ab^{2} + b^{3} \right)  \\ 
& = a^{4} + 3 a^{3} b + 3 a^{2} b^{2} + ab^{3} + a^{3} b + 3 a^{2} b^{2} + 3 ab^{3} + b^{4}  \\
& = (1)a^{4} + (3 + 1) a^{3} b + (3 + 3) a^{2} b^{2} + (1 + 3) ab^{3} + (1)b^{4} \\ 
& = a^{4} + 4 a^{3} b + 6 a^{2} b^{2} + 4 ab^{3} + b^{4}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}


Now assume that for natural number exponent _k_ \[ (a+b)^{k} = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k} {k\choose i} a^{k-i} b^{i} \]  

Multiply by another factor of $(a+b)$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
(a+b) \left( \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k} {k\choose i} a^{k-i} b^{i} \right) {} & = a \left(\sum\limits_{i=0}^{k} {k\choose i} a^{k-i} b^{i} \right) + b \left( \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k} {k\choose i} a^{k-i} b^{i} \right)  \\ 
& = \left( \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k} {k\choose i} a^{k+1-i} b^{i} \right) + \left( \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k} {k\choose i} a^{k-i} b^{i+1} \right)  \\
& = \left( {k\choose 0} a^{k+1-0} b^{0} + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k} {k\choose i} a^{k-i} b^{i} \right) + \left( \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-1} {k\choose i} a^{k-i} b^{i+1} + {k\choose k} a^{k-k} b^{k+1} \right)  \\
& = {k\choose 0} a^{k+1-0} b^{0} + \left( \sum\limits_{i=1}^{k} {k\choose i} a^{k-i} b^{i} \right) + \left( \sum\limits_{i=0}^{k-1} {k\choose i} a^{k-i} b^{i+1} \right) + {k\choose k} a^{k-k} b^{k+1} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
