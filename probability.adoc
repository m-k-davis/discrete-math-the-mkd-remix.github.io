DISCRETE PROBABILITY (MKD) - new chapter is needed for this
    ACM CCECC Discrete Mathematics course 
    	includes "Discrete Probability" under the topic "Combinatorics" 
    	but lists no specific probability content.    
    COMP 152 Discrete Probability and DS6.
        Finite probability space, 
        probability measure, 
        events
        Conditional probability, 
        independence, 
        Bayes’ theorem
        Integer random variables, 
        expectation
        Law of large numbers (COMP 152, not DS6)
	2013 changes/additions:
		[Core-Tier1]
			• Finite probability space, events
			• Axioms of probability and probability measures
			• Conditional probability, Bayes’ theorem
			• Independence
			• Integer random variables (Bernoulli, binomial)
			• Expectation, including Linearity of Expectation
		[Core-Tier2]
			• Variance
			• Conditional Independence
