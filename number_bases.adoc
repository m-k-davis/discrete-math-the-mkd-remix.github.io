// MKD - here is the start of this chapter's content

It's likely that you learned, when you were young, how to represent positive integers using *decimal notation* and the *base-ten place-value system.* This system uses ten symbols, called the *Hindu-Arabic numerals*, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, to represent _any_ natural number (zero or positive) by placing the numerals into a string, read from left-to-right, to indicate multiples of descending powers of the base ten. For example, the string 205 (or, more code-like, "205") represents the number described by the phrase "2 hundreds plus 0 tens, plus 5 ones," where 1 hundred is the same as ten tens. Each digit represents a multiple of ten, depending on that digits position. In particular, the number ten, which is the base of the place-value system, is represented by the string "10" and is described by the phrase "1 ten plus 0 ones".


//MKD new section - in progress
==  Numbers, Numerals, and Digits

In everyday life, it is common to treat numbers and numerals as if they are the same. However, it is important in the rest of this chapter to distinguish these concepts.

//: A _number_ is an idea or mental concept and is not the same as its representations by _numerals._ 

//In summary: 

* A *number* is an abstract idea or mental concept of a count, a measure, a rank in an ordering, a quantity, etc.. 
* A *numeral* is a word, phrase, symbol, or string of symbols that is used to represent a number. 
* A *digit* is a single symbol that represents a number. A digit is a numeral, but multiple digits can be combined to create other numerals. For example, each of the ten Hindu-Arabic numerals is a digit that represents a natural number that is less than ten, and multiple Hindu-Arabic numerals can be combined to create numerals that represent numbers that are greater than or equal to ten.

As an example, consider the following words: 

* "five", 
* "cinco", 
* "خمسة" ("khamsa"), 
* "पाँच" ("paanch"), 
* "五" ("wǔ"). 

These words, taken from different languages, are examples of _numerals,_ words that represent a _number._ In fact, all those numerals represent the same number, but no one of the numerals _is_ the number itself, which is an abstract idea. 
// . A number is an abstraction. 
// noun, just like "blue" or "beauty" or "justice".
//Is ❤️ an actual heart? Is it "love"?
In the same way, 

* the Arabic numerals "5" and "٥", 
* the Roman numeral "Ⅴ," 
* Braille "⠑" 

are other ways of representing the same number that the word "five" represents.

In semiotics, which is the study of signs, symbols, and signification, the number is referred to as the *signified* mental concept and the numeral is a *signifier.*

In the same way that we can use multiple words to represent a single number, so can we use a place-value numeral system with a positive integer base _b_ that is different than ten 
// other than base-ten 
to represent a number.


//MKD - moved from Introduction chapter; it fits better here
//* 
//In everyday life we use *base-ten Hindu-Arabic place-value notation* to represent the natural numbers. 
// and integers (as well as real numbers.) 
However, 
//in Computer Science applications 
It is often useful to represent natural numbers using a different *number base*, such as *binary* (base-two), *octal* (base-eight), or *hexadecimal* (base-sixteen). As you may already know, computer arithmetic is based on binary, which is base-two; you can develop algorithms that are much more effective and efficient when this is kept in mind!

Privilege
The use of subscript is not necessary if the context is clear. For example, \[ chmod 755 hello.txt \] 
is a Unix/Linux command that changes file permission bits (read, write, execute) for a file's owner, the file's group, and any other user. In this example, the string "755" is #octal# not decimal. Notice that no subscript or prefix like "o" is used - it is _natural_ to use octal in this context. The reason we use base-ten numerals as subscripts on numerals in other bases is because base-ten is so dominant: It is the "privileged" base, so we need to indicate when a different base is being used. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO IF THE CONTEXT IS CLEAR... of if we want to tell jokes like 

* "There are 10 kinds of people in this world — those who understand binary and those who don’t."

== Integer Representations



In everyday life, we use the base-ten place value system. For example, we write the string "205" to stand for the number 
that is the sum $200 + 5$ 
or more formally as 
$2 \cdot 10^{2} + 0 \cdot 10^{1} + 5 \cdot 10^{0}$ (This is sometimes referred to as *expanded form* in school-level mathematics.)

There is nothing special about the number 10 here, though. We can use any positive integer as the *base* of a place value system.


.Theorem
****
Let $b$ be an integer greater than 1. Any positive integer $n$ can be expressed uniquely in the form \[n = a\_kb^k + a\_{k - 1}b^{k-1} + \cdots + a\_1b^1 + a\_0b^0,\]where $k$ is a nonnegative integer, $a\_0,a\_1,\dots,a\_k$ are nonnegative integers less than $b,$ and $a\_k \neq 0.$

****
////
[click.MKD_INCOMPLETE_Proof]
--
Fix the value of _b_ as a constant integer greater than 1, then use strong mathematical induction on _n_. + 
//Notice that for the base _b,_ 
//the natural number zero corresponds to $k = 0$ and $a\_0 = 0,$ and 
//the natural number one corresponds to $k = 0$ and $a\_0 = 1;$ and in fact 
Notice that for any positive integer _n_ that is less than _b,_ the number _n_ can be written as $n = a\_0b^0,$ which corresponds to $k = 0$ and $a\_0$ is less than _b._ + 
Also, $b = a\_1b^1 + a\_0b^0,$ where $k = 0$ and $a\_0$ is less than _b._ + = n,$ and that
_b_ itself corresponds to $k = 1,$ $a\_1 = 1,$ and $a\_0 = 0;$ this provides the basis for the induction. + 
For the induction step, assume that $n > b$ and that all integers less than $n$ can be written in the form described. In particular, \[n-1 = a\_kb^k + a\_{k - 1}b^{k-1} + \cdots + a\_1b^1 + a\_0b^0,\]where $k$ is a nonnegative integer, $a\_0,a\_1,\dots,a\_k$ are nonnegative integers less than $b,$ and $a\_k \neq 0.$ If $a\_0 + 1$ is less than _b_, we can simply add 1 to both sides to get \[n = a\_kb^k + a\_{k - 1}b^{k-1} + \cdots + a\_1b^1 + (a\_0 + 1)b^0.\] On the other hand, if $a\_0 + 1 = b,$ then we would need to worry about carrying from the ones place, so instead we can subtract _b_ from _n_ to get a positive number $n - b$ that can \_0$ INCOMPLETE

Let $b$ be an integer greater than 1 and let $n$ be a positive integer. The representation of $n$ in the above theorem is referred to as the *base $b$ expansion of $n$*. We refer to $a\_k,a\_{k-1},\dots,a\_0,a\_1$ as *digits*. We represent the base $b$ expansion of $n$ using the following notation: \[(a\_ka\_{k-1}\dots a\_1a\_0)\_b.\]


The base 10 expansion of a positive integer is referred to as the *decimal  expansion*. When expressing the decimal expansion of a positive integer, we typically omit the subscript 10.


//MKD adds 
Notice that the subscript _b_ in this notation is written using the _base-ten_ decimal expansion for _b._

.Example {counter:numex}
What is the decimal expansion of the positive integer with base 7 expansion $(1063)\_7$?

.Solution

We have

[env.equationalign]
--
(1063)\_7 &= 1 \cdot 7^3 + 0 \cdot 7^2 + 6\cdot 7^1 + 3 \cdot 7^0\\
&=1 \cdot 343 + 0 \cdot 49 + 6 \cdot 7 + 3 \cdot 1\\
&= 343 + 0 + 42 + 3\\
&= 388.

****

Several common bases used in computer science are base $2$, base $8$, and base $16$, which are referred to as *binary*, *octal*, and *hexadecimal*, respectively. Binary digits are often referred to as *bits*. Note that, when finding the hexadecimal expansion of a positive integer, in addition to the usual digits $0$ through $9,$ we require an additional 6 digits. We will represent these by the letters $\mathrm{A}$ through $\mathrm{F}$, where $(\mathrm{A})\_{16} = 10,$ $(\mathrm{B})\_{16} = 11,$ $(\mathrm{C})\_{16} = 12,$ $(\mathrm{D})\_{16} = 13,$ $(\mathrm{E})\_{16} = 14,$ and $(\mathrm{F})\_{16} = 15.$

****
.Example {counter:numex} - Hexadecimal expansion
Find the decimal expansion of the positive integer whose hexadecimal expansion is $(5\mathrm{B}\mathrm{F})\_{16}.$

.Solution
We have
[env.equationalign]
--
(5\mathrm{B}\mathrm{F})\_{16} &= 5\cdot 16^2 + 11 \cdot 16^1 + 15 \cdot 16^0\\
&= 5\cdot 256 + 11 \cdot 16 + 15 \cdot 1\\
&= 1280 + 176 + 15\\
&= 1471.

== Base Conversion

Let $b$ be an integer greater than $1$ and let $n$ be a positive integer. In order to find the base $b$ expansion of $n,$ we can use the following algorithm. First, we use the division algorithm to find integers $q\_0$ and $a\_0,$ with $0 \leq a_0 < b,$ such that \[n = bq\_0 + a\_0.\]Then, if $q\_0 \neq 0,$ we again use the division algorithm to find integers $q\_1$ and $a\_1,$ with $0 \leq a\_1 < b,$ such that \[q\_0 = bq\_1 + a\_1.\] Then, if $q\_1 \neq 0,$ we again use the division algorithm to find integers $q\_2$ and $a\_2,$ with $0 \leq a\_2 < b,$ such that \[q\_1 = bq\_2 + a\_2.\]We continue this process until we obtain a quotient of $0$; that is, until, for some positive integer $k,$ we have $q\_k = 0.$ Then, we have \[n = (a\_ka\_{k-1}\dots a\_1a\_0)\_b.\]

****
.Example {counter:numex} - Base Conversion Algorithm
Find the base $6$ expansion for $2235$.

.Solution

We have

[env.equationalign]
--
2235 &= 6\cdot 372 + 3,\\
372 &= 6 \cdot 62 + 0,\\
62 &= 6 \cdot 10 + 2,\\
10 &= 6\cdot 1 + 4,\\
1 &= 6 \cdot 0 + 1.
--

Since we have reached a quotient of $0$, we are finished. Thus, we see that \[2235 = (14203)\_6.\]

Suppose we want to convert the positive integer $n$ from hexadecimal to binary. One method would be to first convert from
$n$ from hexadecimal to decimal, and the convert the result from decimal to binary. However, we can also take advantage of the fact
that $2^4 = 16.$ This implies that we can express each hexadecimal digit of $(n)\_{16}$ uniquely as a block of 4 bits as
follows:
[latexmath]
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\begin{array}{llll}
(0)_{16} = (0000)_2 & (1)_{16} = (0001)_{2}& (2)_{16} = (0010)_2 & (3)_{16} = (0011)_2 \\
(4)_{16} = (0100)_2& (5)_{16} = (0101)_2& (6)_{16} = (0110)_2 & (7)_{16} = (0111)_2\\
(8)_{16} = (1000)_2& (9)_{16} = (1001)_2& (\mathrm{A})_{16} = (1010)_2& (\mathrm{B})_{16} = (1011)_2\\
(\mathrm{C})_{16} = (1100)_2& (\mathrm{D})_{16} = (1101)_2& (\mathrm{E})_{16} = (1110)_2&  (\mathrm{F})_{16} = (1111)_2.
\end{array}
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
We then concatenate our blocks, removing any leading zeros if necessary.


****
.Example {counter:numex} - Hexadecimal to Binary Conversion
Find the binary expansion of $(4\mathrm{C}\mathrm{A}7)\_{16}.$

.Solution
We have the following:
[latexmath]
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\begin{array}{llll}
(4)_{16} = (0100)_2 & (\mathrm{C})_{16} = (1100)_2 & (\mathrm{A})_{16} = (1010)_2 & (7)_{16} = (0111)_2.
\end{array}
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Thus, we see that \[(4\mathrm{C}\mathrm{A}7)\_{16} = (100110010100111)\_{2}.\]

****

To convert $n$ from binary to hexadecimal, we simply break up $(n)_2$ into blocks of 4 binary digits, adding a suitable number of
leading zeros if necessary. We convert each block of 4 bits to hexadecimal digits and concatenate our results, removing any leading
zeros if necessary.

****
.Example {counter:numex} - Binary to Hexadecimal Conversion
Find the hexadecimal expansion of $(110 1011 1111)_2.$

.Solution
We have the following blocks of 4 bits: \[0110,\ 1011,\ 1111.\]
Since $(0110)\_2 = (6)\_{16},$ $(1011)\_2 = (\mathrm{B})\_{16},$ and $(1111)\_2 = (\mathrm{F})\_{16},$ we see that \[(11010111111)\_{2} = (6\mathrm{B}\mathrm{F})\_{16}.\]
