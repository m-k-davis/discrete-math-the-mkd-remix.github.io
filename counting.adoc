= Counting


Many of us learned how to count when we were young children, but we probably never counted up to more than 100, or perhaps at most 1000. However, there are many problems that arise in math and computer science that require counting the number of elements of sets that contain much greater numbers of elements - hundreds of thousands of elements, or millions, or even more. 

This chapter introduces techniques for 
//finding the size (cardinality) of a 
counting the number of elements of finite sets. 
These techniques can be used quickly and efficiently no matter the size of the set.

== Three Basic Counting Rules

There are three basic counting rules 
//used 
introduced in this section, one for each of 
the arithmetic operations of multiplication, addition and subtraction.

=== The Product Rule (_and_)
To find the total number of outcomes for two or more successive events where both events must occur, multiply the number of outcomes for each event together.  For instance, if you want to find the number of outcomes possible when you roll a die and toss a coin, you could use the product rule. It is important to note that the events must be independent, meaning one doesn't effect the other.

.The Product Rule
****
If there are $n$ ways event $E$ can occur and $m$ ways to event $F$ can occur, where the occurance of $E$ has no effect on $F$, then there are $nm$ ways $E$ and $F$ can occur.
****

This is called the product rule for counting because it involves multiplying to find a product. The product rule can be extended to more than two choices.

[NOTE]
Think of the product rule when you see AND.

****
.Example {counter:countexample}
A startup with four employee rents an office suite with seven offices. How many ways are there to assign the employees?

.Solution
The first employee has 7 offices to choose from, the second has 6 offices to choose from, the third can choose from 5, and the fourth can choose from 4. By the
product rule, there are $7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 = 840$ ways to assign the offices.

.Example {counter:countexample}
Suppose there are 27 computers in a computer center and each computer has 15 ports. How many different ways are there to choose a specific port?

.Solution
Choosing a port means you first choose a computer and then a port on that computer. Since there are 27 computers and 15 ways to choose a port on a computer, there are $27 \times 15 = 405$ ways to choose a port.

=== The Sum Rule (_xor_)

//Consider finding the total number of ways a particular event occurs from a variety of different options.  For instance, if you want to find the number of ways to pick an ITEC major to win a prize knowing there are students from many concentrations, you could use the sum rule.  It is important to note the events must be mutually exclusive, meaning they do not have anything in common.

Consider finding the total number of ways a particular event occurs from a variety of different mutually exclusive options (mutually exclusive means that the options do not have anything in common.) For instance, if you want to find the number of ways to pick, at random, a student enrolled in Discrete Math this semester, you could use the sum rule to add the number of students in each section of Discrete Math (assuming that no student is enrolled in more than one section).

.The Sum Rule
****
If there are $n$ ways event $E$ can occur and $m$ ways event $F$ can occur, and suppose that both events cannot occur at the same time, then there are $n + m$ ways for $E$ or $F$ to occur.
****
This is called the sum rule for counting because it involves adding to find a total. The sum rule can also be extended to more than two choices.

[NOTE]
Think of the sum rule when you see OR.

****
.Example {counter:countexample}
A student in a Capstone course can choose a project from three different professors. The professors have 3, 7, and 4 possible projects, and no project
is on more than one professor's list. How many possible projects can the student choose?

.Solution
The student can pick out a project by choosing from the first professor, the second professor, or the third professor. Since no project is on more than
one list, the sum rules says that there are $3 + 7 + 4 = 14$ projects to choose from.

=== The Subtraction Rule (_or_)
If your events are not mutually exclusive, to find the total number of possibilities use the subtraction rule.

.The Subtraction Rule
****
Suppose event $E$ can occur $n$ ways, event $F$ can occur $m$ ways, and there are $p$ ways that $E$ and $F$ both occur. Then there are $n+m-p$ ways
$E$ or $F$ can occur.

//MKD Edited next sentence and moved all into the box
//The subtraction rule is also called the inclusion-exclusion principle.
Note that the subtraction rule is just a special case of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion seen in the chapter Set Theory.
****

****
.Example {counter:countexample}
A tech company recieves 200 applications for a position. 150 of the applicants were ITEC majors, 43 were business majors, and 25 were double majors in
business and ITEC. 
// MKD application -> applicants
How many applicants did not major in ITEC or business?

.Solution
By the subtraction rule, there are $150 + 43 - 25 = 168$ applicants that majored in ITEC or business. Thus $200 - 168 = 32$ majored in neither of these.
****

****
.Example {counter:countexample}
How many bit strings of length four start with 1 or end with 00?

.Solution
A bit string of length four that starts with 1 will be of the form $1~*~*~*$. For each $*$ there are two choices, 0 or 1, so by the product rule, there are $2^3$ bit strings of this form. A bit string of length four that ends with 00 will be of the form $*~*~0~0$, so there are $2^2$ bit strings of this form.
Finally,
a bit string of length four that starts with 1 and ends with 00 will be of the form $1~*~0~0$, so there are 2 bit strings of this form. By the subtraction rule
there are $2^3 + 2^2 - 2 = 8+4-2=10$ possibilities.

== Permutations and Combinations


//MKD added subsection header and text

Many counting problems involve choosing, from a set of $n$ objects, either an ordered sequence of $r$ objects or a subset of $r$ objects, with no repetition allowed. We will describe ways to do this type of counting in this section.

=== Permutations

// MKD rewrote this paragraph
//Consider the first four letters of the alphabet, $A, B, C, D$. A //*permutation* of these letters would be an arrangement of them in //different orders.

A *permutation* of a set of elements is an ordered arrangement of the elements. 
// MKD added
A permutation may involve every element of the set, or only some of the elements of the set.

Consider the first four letters of the English alphabet, $A, B, C, D$.

* $ABCD, BACD, ABDC$ are permutations of the letters taken four at a time
* $BDA, ABC, ABD$ are permutations of the letters taken three at a time
* $AB, AC, DB$ are permutations of the letters taken two at a time

// MKD added the following paragraph
By listing all possible permutations of $A, B, C, D$, we can determine that 
there are 24 permutations of the letters taken four at a time, 
24 permutations of the letters taken three at a time, 
and 6 permutations of the letters taken three at a time. 
But what if we wanted to find all the possible permutations of the twenty six letters $A, B, C, D, \ldots , X, Y, Z$? It is very time consuming to write out all possible permutations of the twenty six letters taken, say, twenty one at a time, so we will develop a method and formula for doing this.

In general, given a set of $n$ objects, an _ordered arrangment_ of $r \le n$ of 
//them 
the objects is called an *$r$-permutation* or a *permutation of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time*. We 
//will denote this by 
use the notation 
$P(n,r)$ to represent the number of permutations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time. Note that $_nP_r$ is 
//a 
another commonly used notation, especially on calculators.

//MKD added the following two paragraphs
Suppose we have $n$ objects and want to construct a $2$-permutation of the objects. There are $n$ possible choices for the first object, and once that object is chosen, there are $n-1$ possible choices for the second object. 
We now use the product rule to conclude that there are $n(n-1)$ ways to choose the two objects; note that the order of the choices matters here.

We can generalize this argument, informally, as follows: Suppose we have $n$ objects and want to construct an $r$-permutation, where $r \le n.$ There are $n$ possible choices for the first object, $n-1$ possible choices for the second object, and so on, until we have $n-(r-1)$ possible choices for the $r\text{th}$ object. Apply the product rule repeatedly to find that there are $ n(n-1)\cdots (n-r+1)$ $r$-permutations of the $n$ objects. 

.Theorem
****
$P(n,r) = n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-r+1)$
// = \displaystyle \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$.
****

// MKD - added text - maybe add an exercise for the induction, too?
Note that a formal proof can be done by using mathematical induction.
// on $r$, treating $n$ as a constant.

.Example {counter:countexample}

If there are 10 runners in a race, how many different ways can the gold, silver, and bronze medals be awarded?

.Solution
There are 10 objects (the runners) and we are choosing 3 to win medals. So the number of ways they can be awarded is


$P(10,3) = \displaystyle \frac{10!}{(10-3)!} = \frac{10!}{7!} = 10 \times 9 \times 8 = 720$

//MKD added subsection header 

=== Combinations

A selection 
of objects from a set of $n$ objects 
where order 
of selection 
does not matter is called a *combination*. 
Notice that each combination corresponds to a subset of the set of $n$ objects.
//, that is, each combination is the unordered list that describes a subset.

Consider the letters $A, B, C, D$ and choose three at a time where the order does not matter. 
//That is, the choice $ABC$ is the same choice as $BCA$.  
//MKD inserted sentences
In this case we are selecting a subset of size three instead of a sequence of length three. The sets $\{ A, B, C \}$ and $\{ B, C, A \}$ are just two ways of describing the same set since the order in which elements of a set are listed does not matter.  

//This 
//A selection where order does not matter is called a *combination*. 
* There are four possible ways to choose three letters without regard to order:
//*$ABC, ABD, ACD,$ and $BCD$.
$\{ A, B, C \}$, 
$\{ A, B, D \}$, 
$\{ A, C, D \}$, and 
$\{ B, C, D \}$.
* There are six possible ways to choose three letters without regard to order:
$\{ A, B \}$, 
$\{ A, C \}$, 
$\{ A, D \}$, 
$\{ B, C \}$, 
$\{ B, D \}$, and 
$\{ C, D \}$. 
* There are four possible ways to choose one letter (without regard to order):
//*$ABC, ABD, ACD,$ and $BCD$.
$\{ D \}$, 
$\{ C \}$, 
$\{ B \}$, and 
$\{ A \}$. (Keep reading to find out why this "reversed" ordering of the subsets was used.)


This shows that there are 
4 combinations of 4 objects taken 3 at a time,  
6 combinations of 4 objects taken 2 at a time, and 
4 combinations of 4 objects taken 1 at a time.  


In general, given a set of $n$ objects, 
//and 
an 
_unordered selection_ of $r\le n$ of them is 
called 
an *$r$-combination* or a *combination of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time*. We will denote this by $C(n,r)$, read as '$n$ choose $r$'. Note that $_nC_r$ is commonly used by calculators.

Using this notation, we can write $C(4,3) = 4$, $C(4,2) = 6$, and $C(4,1) = 4$.


Notice that $C(4,3) = C(4,1)$; it may appear that this "just happens to be true", but in fact is an example of the next theorem. In this case, a combination of 4 objects taken 3 at a time corresponds to a combination of 4 objects taken 1 at a time - we can choose 3 of the 4 elements by "throwing out" the 1 element we don't want to keep. That is, we choose the 3-element subset we care about indirectly by instead choosing the 1-element complement of the subset.

In general, there is always a one-to-one correspondence between 
the combinations of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time and the combinations of $n$ objects taken $n-r$ at a time: Choosing $r$ elements for a subset corresponds to choosing the $n-r$ elements for the complement of the subset. 

// MKD - need to add this to set theory chapter after May 24, 2024:
// The one-to-one correspondence on power set that maps A to its complement.

.Theorem
****
$C(n,r) = C(n,n-r)$
****

A formal proof of the theorem can be written by proving that, for any set $S$, the function with domain and codomain $\mathcal{P}(S)$ and that maps each subset of $S$ to its complement is both injective and surjective.


//MKD added the following two paragraphs
Next, notice that every $r$-combination corresponds to $P(r, r) = r!$ different $r$-permutations. That is, to select a $r$-permutation we could instead first select a $r$-combination without regard to order and then order the $r$ elements. 

As an example, suppose we have $n$ objects and want to construct a $3$-permutation. We could instead first choose a $3$-combination of the objects. There are $C(n,3)$ possible $3$-combinations. Once we have chosen a specific $3$-combination, we can reorder the 3 elements 
//in the subset of 3 elements 
in $P(3,3) = 3!$ ways. 
This argument shows that 
$P(n,3) = C(n,3) \cdot P(3,3) =  C(n,3) \cdot 3!$, so 
$C(n,3) = \displaystyle \frac{P(n,3)}{3!}$. 

We can generalize this argument for each natural number $r \leq n$ to arrive at the next theoren.

.Theorem
****
$C(n,r) = \displaystyle \frac{P(n,r)}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
****

// MKD - added text - maybe add an exercise for the induction, too?
A formal proof of the theorem can be done by using mathematical induction.
// on $r$, treating $n$ as a constant.

.Example {counter:countexample}
How many ways can five cards be dealt from a standard 52-card deck?

.Solution
We are choosing 5 cards from 52 cards and the order does not matter, so $C(52,5)=\displaystyle \frac{52!}{5!47!}$
****


****
.Example {counter:countexample}
How many bit strings of length $n$ contain exactly $r$ 0s?

.Solution
Choosing the positions of the $r$ 0s corresponds to the $r$-combinations of the set $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}$. Thus there are exactly
$C(n,r)$ such bit strings.
