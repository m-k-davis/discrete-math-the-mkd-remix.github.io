= Counting

COMING SOON!
////

There are three basic counting rules used in this section, one for each of the arithmetic operations of multiplication, addition and subtraction.

== The Product Rule (_and_)
To find the total number of outcomes for two or more successive events where both events must occur, multiply the number of outcomes for each event together.  For instance, if you want to find the number of outcomes possible when you roll a die and toss a coin, you could use the product rule. It is important to note that the events must be independent, meaning one doesn't effect the other.

.The Product Rule
****
If there are $n$ ways event $E$ can occur and $m$ ways to event $F$ can occur, where the occurance of $E$ has no effect on $F$, then there are $nm$ ways $E$ and $F$ can occur.
****

This is called the product rule for counting because it involves multiplying to find a product. The product rule can be extended to more than two choices.

[NOTE]
Think of the product rule when you see AND.

****
.Example {counter:countexample}
A startup with four employee rents an office suite with seven offices. How many ways are there to assign the employees?

.Solution
The first employee has 7 offices to choose from, the second has 6 offices to choose from, the third can choose from 5, and the fourth can choose from 4. By the
product rule, there are $7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 = 840$ ways to assign the offices.

****
.Example {counter:countexample}
Suppose there are 27 computers in a computer center and each computer has 15 ports. How many different ways are there to choose a specific port?

.Solution
Choosing a port means you first choose a computer and then a port on that computer. Since there are 27 computers and 15 ways to choose a port on a computer, there are $27 \times 15 = 405$ ways to choose a port.

.You Try
How many functions are there from a set $A$ with $m$ elements to a set $B$ with $n$ elements?

== The Sum Rule (_xor_)
Consider finding the total number of ways a particular event occurs from a variety of different options.  For instance, if you want to find the number of ways to pick an ITEC major to win a prize knowing there are students from many concentrations, you could use the sum rule.  It is important to note the events must be mutually exclusive, meaning they do not have anything in common.

.The Sum Rule
****
If there are $n$ ways event $E$ can occur and $m$ ways event $F$ can occur, and suppose that both events cannot occur at the same time, then there are $n + m$ ways for $E$ or $F$ to occur.
****
This is called the sum rule for counting because it involves adding to find a total. The sum rule can also be extended to more than two choices.

[NOTE]
Think of the sum rule when you see OR.

****
.Example {counter:countexample}
A student in a Capstone course can choose a project from three different professors. The professors have 3, 7, and 4 possible projects, and no project
is on more than one professor's list. How many possible projects can the student choose?

.Solution
The student can pick out a project by choosing from the first professor, the second professor, or the third professor. Since no project is on more than
one list, the sum rules says that there are $3 + 7 + 4 = 14$ projects to choose from.

== The Subtraction Rule (_or_)
If your events are not mutually exclusive, to find the total number of possibilities use the subtraction rule.

.The Subtraction Rule
****
Suppose event $E$ can occur $n$ ways, event $F$ can occur $m$ ways, and there are $p$ ways that $E$ and $F$ both occur. Then there are $n+m-p$ ways
$E$ or $F$ can occur.
****
The subtraction rule is also called the inclusion-exclusion principle.
****
.Example {counter:countexample}
A tech company recieves 200 applications for a position. 150 of the applicants were ITEC majors, 43 were business majors, and 25 were double majors in
business and ITEC. How many application did not major in ITEC or business?

.Solution
By the subtraction rule, there are $150 + 43 - 25 = 168$ applicants that majored in ITEC or business. Thus $200 - 168 = 32$ majored in neither of these.
****

****
.Example {counter:countexample}
How many bit strings of length four start with 1 or end with 00?

.Solution
A bit string of length four that starts with 1 will be of the form $1~*~*~*$. For each $*$ there are two choices, 0 or 1, so by the product rule, there are $2^3$ bit strings of this form. A bit string of length four that ends with 00 will be of the form $*~*~0~0$, so there are $2^2$ bit strings of this form.
Finally,
a bit string of length four that starts with 1 and ends with 00 will be of the form $1~*~0~0$, so there are 2 bit strings of this form. By the subtraction rule
there are $2^3 + 2^2 - 2 = 8+4-2=10$ possibilities.

== The Pigeonhole Principle

A suprising number of counting problems can be solved with the so-called pigeonhole principle.

.Pigeon Hole Principle
****
If $n+1$ pigeons are resting in $n$ pigeonholes then at least one pigeonhold contains more than one pigeon.
****

.You Try

****


== Permutations and Combinations

Consider the first four letters of the alphabet, $A, B, C, D$. A *permutation* of these letters would be an arrangement of them in different orders.

* $ABCD, BACD, ABDC$ are permutations of the letters taken four at a time
* $BDA, ABC, ABD$ are permuations of the letters taken three at a time
* $AB, AC, DB$ are permutations of the letters taken two at a time

In general, given a set of $n$ objects, an _ordered arrangment_ of $r \le n$ of them is called an *$r$-permutation* or a *permutation of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time*. We will denote this by $P(n,r)$. (Note that $_nP_r$ is a commonly used notation, especially on calculators.)

.Theorem
****
$P(n,r) = n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-r+1) = \displaystyle \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$.

.Example {counter:countexample}

If there are 10 runners in a race, how many different ways can the gold, silver, and bronze medals be awarded?

.Solution
There are 10 objects (the runners) and we are choosing 3 to win medals. So the number of ways they can be awarded is


$P(10,3) = \displaystyle \frac{10!}{(10-3)!} = \frac{10!}{7!} = 10 \times 9 \times 8 = 720$

Alternatively, we could have used the product rule and noticed that there are 10 ways to award the gold, then there are 9 ways to award the silver,
then 8 ways to award the brozne.
****

****
.Example {counter:countexample}
How many permutations of the digits 0123456789 are there that contain the string 456?

.Solution
We can regard this as a permutation of 8 objects: the string 456 and the other 7 digits. Since they can occur in any order, the number of permutations is

$P(8,8) = 8! = 40320.$

From a group of 100 workers, how many ways can there be a union President, Vice President, and Treasurer?

.You Try
How many different words (including nonsense words), can be formed using the letters in 'HEROIC' where the vowels must appear together?
****

Now consider the letters $A, B, C, D$ and choose three at a time where the order does not matter. That is, the choice $ABC$ is the same choice as $BCA$.  This selection where order does not matter is called a *combination*. There are only four possible ways to choose three letters without regard to order:

*$ABC, ABD, ACD,$ and $BCD$.

In general, given a set of $n$ objects, and _unordered selection_ of $r\le n$ of them is an *$r$-combination* or a *combination of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time*. We will denote this by $C(n,r)$, read as '$n$ choose $r$'. (Note that $_nC_r$ is commonly used by calculators.)

.Theorem
****
$C(n,r) = \displaystyle \frac{P(n,r)}{r!} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

How many ways can five cards be dealt from a standard 52-card deck?

.Solution
We are choosing 5 cards from 52 cards and the order does not matter, so $C(52,5)=\displaystyle \frac{52!}{5!47!}$

.Example {counter:countexample}
How many bit strings of length $n$ contain exactly $r$ 0s?

.Solution
Choosing the positions of the $r$ 0s corresponds to the $r$-combinations of the set $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}$. Thus there are exactly
$C(n,r)$ such bit strings.
