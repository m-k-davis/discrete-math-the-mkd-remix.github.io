== Linear Functions And Their Equations

A *linear function* is one that has a constant rate of change.

\begin{array}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
 & x & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
 \hline \\
 & y & 1 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 9
\end{array}

The table above displays a function with 
independent variable $x$ and 
dependent variable $y$. 

Notice that the value of $y$ increases by $2$ 
for each increase in $x$ by $1$. 
The rate of change of this function is $2$; this 
corresponds to the *slope* $m$ of the continuous line 
that passes through the points with $xy$-coordinates 
given in the table. 

The *vertical intercept* $b$ (in this case, the *_y-_intercept*) is 
the $y$-value that corresponds to $x = 0$, that is, $(0,\,b)$ is 
on the same continuous line as the 
 points represented in the table. In this example, $0$ is not 
a value of $x$, but we can still find the vertical intercept 
by _subtracting_ $1$ from the smallest $x$-value and 
 _subtracting_ $2$ from the corresponding $y$-value , which tells 
 us that the point $(0,\,-1)$ lies on the same continuous line as the 
 points represented in the table.
 
The equation of the linear function determined 
by the points in the table is $y = 2 \cdot x + (-1)$, 
which can be written more simply as $y = 2x - 1$. 
This also is the equation of the continuous line that passes 
through the points with $xy$-coordinates 
given in the table, but the linear function can be restricted to 
a smaller domain as needed by the context where it is being used, 
for example, we may only need to use inputs $x$ from the set of 
positive integers or possibly just the set 
$\{ 1,\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5 \}$.


== Arithmetic Sequences

An *arithmetic sequence* or *arithmetic progression* is a sequence of numbers $a_{0}, \, a_{1}, \, a_{2}, \, \ldots$ such that there is a constant $d$ so that \[ a_{i+1}-a_{i} = d \text{ for all } i \in \mathbb{N}\]
The constant $d$ is called the *common difference* of the sequence. The sequence can be infinite, defined for every $i \in \mathbb{N},$ or finite, defined only for $i \in \mathbb{N}$ less than some greatest index $n$. 

As an example, the sequence $1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16$ is a finite arithmetic sequence with common difference 3 and index set $\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}.$ We can extend that sequence to an infinite arithmetic sequence $1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, \ldots$ using a recursive definition \[a_{0} = 1, \text{ and } a_{i+1} = a_{i} + 3 \text{ for integer } \in \mathbb{N} \]

Notice that there is also a nonrecursive definition for this sequence: Since the difference between two consecutive terms of the sequence is always $d$ the points $(i, \, a_{i})$ must lie on a line in the _xy_-plane. The slope of this line is $d$ and the _y_-intercept of the line is the initial value $a_{0},$ so the arithmetic sequence can also be described as \[ a_{i}= d \cdot i + a_{0} \text{ for all } i \in \mathbb{N}\]

For the example $1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, \ldots$, the nonrecursive definition is \[a_{i} = 3i + 1 \text{ for all } i \in \mathbb{N}\]

== Geometric Sequences

A *geometric sequence* or *geometric progression* is a sequence of numbers $a_{0}, \, a_{1}, \, a_{2}, \, \ldots$ such that there is a constant $r$ so that \[ a_{i+1} = r \cdot a_{i} \text{ for all } i \in \mathbb{N}\]
The constant $r$ is called the *common ratio* of the sequence. The sequence can be infinite, defined for every $i \in \mathbb{N},$ or finite, defined only for $i \in \mathbb{N}$ less than some greatest index $n$. 

As an example, the sequence $5, 10, 20, 40, 80$ is a finite geometric sequence with common ratio 2 and index set $\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \}.$ We can extend that sequence to an infinite geometric sequence $5, 10, 20, 40, 80, \ldots$ using a recursive definition \[a_{0} = 5, \text{ and } a_{i+1} = a_{i} \cdot 2 \text{ for integer } i \in \mathbb{N} \]

There is also a nonrecursive definition for this sequence: Since the ratio between a term and its predecessor in the sequence is always $r$ the points $(i, \, a_{i})$ must lie on the graph of an exponential function in the _xy_-plane. The _y_-intercept of the graph is the initial value $a_{0},$ so the geometric sequence can be described as \[ a_{i} = a_{0} \cdot r^{i} \text{ for all } i \in \mathbb{N}\]

For the example $5, 10, 20, 40, 80, \ldots$, the nonrecursive definition is \[a_{i} = 5 \cdot 2^{i} \text{ for all } i \in \mathbb{N}\]

// MKD NEEDS TO EDIT ALL BELOW

Functions can in many cases be visualized graphically,
for example when mapping from the real line, $\mathbb{R}$
to the real line, such maps are viewed on a Cartesian plan.

== Quadratic Function

The function $f(x) =x^2$, denotes the association $(a,b) =(x, x^2)$ with
$f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. We notice that the range is the set of
real numbers $[0,  \infty)= \mathbb{R}^{+}$.
The function is not invertible, since it is not injective. For example, we have both $f(-3) =9$ and $f(3)=9$.
With $f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ notice that the range is now $\mathbb{N}$


\begin{array}{lccccccccccc}
 & x & -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
  &  x^2  & 25 & 16 & 9 & 4 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 4 & 9 & 16 & 25

== The Cubic function


The function $f(x) =x^3$, denotes the association $(a,b) =(x, x^3)$ with
$f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Also, we notice that the range is the set of all real
numbers $(- \infty ,  \infty)=\mathbb{R}$.
The function is bijective and so invertible.
With $f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$, notice that the range,
in addition to domain, is also    $\mathbb{Z}$

   & x & -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
   &  x^3 & -125 & -64 & -27 & -8 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 8 & 27 & 64 & 125

== The Square Root and Cube Root Functions
For the purposes of completeness and for comparing
how fast functions $f(x)$ grow for large x, we present the
inverse of the functions
$f(x)= x^2$ and $f(x)= x^3$, when
$f(x):\mathbb{R}+→\mathbb{R}+$. Respectively, the functions$ f(x)=\sqrt{x}$
and $f(x)= $ asciimath:[root(3)(x)].

== Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

We begin by summarizing important properties of exponentials.

.Properties of Exponentials
****
.. For $a>0, a  ≠ 1$,
$a^m.\ a^n=a^{m+n}$. For example, $3^4\cdot 3^5=3^{4+5}=3^9$.

.. $\frac{a^m}{a^n}=a^{m-n}$. For example,
$\frac{3^5}{3^2}=3^{5-2}=3^3 $.

.. $\left(a^m\right)^n=a^{m.n\ }$. For example, $\left(3^4\right)^3=3^{4\cdot 3}=3^{12}$.

.. $\left(a.b\right)^m=a^mb^m$. For example, $\left(3x\right)^4=3^4.x^4$

.. $a^0=1$

.. $a^{-1}=\frac{1}{a}$ For example, $3^{-1}=\frac{1}{3}$.

.. $ a^\frac{1}{n}=root(n)(a)$.

=== Exponential Functions

Exponential functions are of the form
$f\left(x\right)=b^x$, where $b$ is the base and the variable $x$
is in the exponent. The base  $b>0$ and $b  ≠ 1$. Properties of
exponential functions come from properties of exponents.
When the base $b$ is greater than 1 the exponential function is increasing exponentially,
as in the case $f(x) = 2^x$.

\begin{array}{llcccccccccl}
  & x & -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
  & 2^x & \frac{1}{32} & \frac{1}{16} & \frac{1}{8} & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{2} & 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 & 16 & 32
\end{array}

When the base $b$ is less than 1 the exponential function is decreasing exponentially, as in the
case $f(x) = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) ^x$.



\begin{array}{llcccccccccl}
 & x & -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
 & (\frac{1}{3})^x  & 243 & 81 & 27 & 9 & 3 & 1 & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{27} & \frac{1}{81} & \frac{1}{243}
\end{array}

=== Logarithmic Functions

Logarithmic functions are the inverse functions corresponding
to exponential functions and are used to solve exponential equations.
For example, $y=2^x$ is solved for $x$ by inverting $x=\log_2{y}$.
Properties of logarithms follow from this relationship
between exponentials and logarithms and properties of the
exponentials.

We summarize three important properties of logarithms.


.Properties of Logarithms
****
.. The exponential function $f\left(x\right)=y=b^x$, written in exponential
form is $\log_b{f\left(x\right)=\log_b{y=x}}$.  Its inverse is the logarithmic
function $x=b^y$, which is denoted   $y=\log_b{x}$.

.. The power rule for logarithms states
that $\log_b m^x=x\cdot \log_b m$.

.. Comparing the solutions of $2^x$, $x=\log_2{5}\text{,}$ and $x=\frac{\log_{10}{5}}{\log_{10}{2}}$, gives
$\log_2{5}=\frac{\log_{10}{5}}{\log_{10}{2}}$, which, essentially, is the change of base formula
$\log_b{A}=\frac{\log_a{A}}{\log_a{b}}$.

****


All  other properties of logarithmic functions come from properties relating the logarithm as
the inverse of the exponential and the equivalence of the logarithm $a =\log_b m$ with $b^a=m$.


When the base $b$ is greater than 1, the logarithm function is increasing, as in the case $f(x) = \log_2 x$.

\begin{array}{llllllcccccc}
  & x & \frac{1}{32} & \frac{1}{16} & \frac{1}{8} & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{2} & 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 & 16 & 32 \\
  & log_2 x & -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5
\end{array}

When the base $b$ is less than 1, the logarithm function is decreasing exponentially, as in the case $f(x) = \log_{\frac{1}{3}} \ x$.


\begin{array}{llllllcccccl}
  & x & \frac{1}{243} & \frac{1}{81} & \frac{1}{27} & \frac{1}{9} & \frac{1}{3} & 1 & 3 & 9 & 27 & 81 & 243 \\
  & \log_{\frac{1}{3}} x & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -2 & -3 & -4 & -5
