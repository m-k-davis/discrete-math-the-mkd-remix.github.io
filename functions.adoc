(MKD: Is the following list from James Wong's slides?)
Function, domain, codomain, range
Equality of functions (same domain, codomain, and ordered pairs)
One-to-one (injective)
Onto (surjective) - NOTE this is why the codomain is part of the definition
1-1 Correspondence (bijective i.e. both one-to-one and onto)
Compostion of Functions
Inverse functions
adding and multiplying functions
sequence as a function mapping {0, 1, 2..., n} to a set
subsequence
summation notation, double summations
Pigeonhole Principle (? using function notation)
Cardinality - finite sets, infinite sets (countable, uncountable)
Examples: even naturals, integers, pairs of natural numbers, Q, reals (Cantor diagonlization)




MKD MOVED THIS FROM Intro - 
then revised to contrast reals and integers
** $f(n) = 2n+1$ where _n_ is an integer.
*** The domain is the set of integers.
*** The range is the set of odd integers: Every odd integer is of the form $q \cdt 2 + 1$ for some integer _q._ 
*** The codomain is the set of integers.
** $f(x) = 2x+1$ where _x_ is a real number.
*** The domain is the set of real number.
*** The range is the set of real numbers. 
*** The codomain is the same set as the range, that is, every real number is an output of the function because we can solve every equation of the form $2x+1 = y$ for _x_, no matter what real number _y_ stands for.
*** This is an example of a one-to-one correspondence. As stated above, we can always solve the equation $2x+1 = y$ for _x:_ If we solve for _x,_ we get $x=\frac{1}{2}(y-1)$ which tells us how to "go back" from an output to its corresponding input. We can write a formula for the *inverse function* by swapping the symbols _x_ and _y_ to get $y=\frac{1}{2}(x-1)$ and then naming a new function with the rule $g(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x-1)$ where _x_ is a real number (The inverse function is also referred to using the symbol $f^{-1}$ which will be discussed in the link:./functions.html[Functions] chapter.)

a function $f$ from set _D_ to set _C_ is a rule that assigns to each input element in _D_ exactly one output element from _C._ The set _D_ is called the domain of the function, and the set _C_ is called the codomain of the function. This informal definition

// Python: The float type in CPython uses a C double for storage.  Floating-point numbers are usually implemented using double in C. Since at least 2000, almost all machines use IEEE 754 binary floating-point arithmetic, and almost all platforms map Python floats to IEEE 754 binary64 “double precision” values.
//sources: https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#why-are-floating-point-calculations-so-inaccurate and https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html and https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html#tut-fp-issues
// Java: The double data type is a double precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. (Note that this is the primitive type, not the Double object wrapper)

//You may already know that, as data types 
//In computing, the implementations of integer data types is very different from the implementations of floating-point data types that are used to represent real numbers. 
//In mathematics, it is common to treat the set of integers as a subset of the set of real numbers, though at a more advanced level of mathematics the integers can also be regarded as very different from the real numbers.

In computing, integer data types are used 
//primarily 
to represent 
//integers 
//natural numbers (and their negatives) (either positive, negative, or zero) 
//such as 
loop 
counters 
//in loops 
or indices into arrays, while floating-point data types are used to represent real numbers 
(like decimals) 
//used 
in scientific or financial calculations. 
//It is important to note that the implementation, in hardware and software, of integer data types is very different from the implementation of floating-point data types. 
//Even though most 
In general, 
a number 
//numbers 
that can be stored using an integer type can also be stored using a floating-point type, 
but 
the _ways_ in which that number can be used will depend on the data type. 
The following code examples show why it is important to keep this in mind when coding. 

First, recall that the link:./introduction_discrete_math.html#informal_floor_and_ceiling_definition[floor of _x_,] written as $\lfloor x \rfloor,$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to the real number _x._ The floor() function is available in both Python and Java as an implementation of $\lfloor x \rfloor.$ In both programming languages floor() takes a double precision floating-point number as its input, but Python floor() returns a value of integer data type while Java floor() function returns a value of floating-point data type. 
//return values are of different data types. + 
//The following two code samples each implement a lookup: The floor of a floating-point number is computed then that result is used as an index into a list or an array.

link:https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9091348[IEEE 754] double precision 64-bit floating-point numbers. For example, the decimal number 1.4 is encoded by the bitstring  \[001111111111011001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011\] of length 64 whether you use a Python `float` with value 1.4 or a Java `double` with value 1.4.

Notice that in the Python code below, the return value from the floor() function is an _int_ which we can then use as an index into list L.

Now notice that in the Java code below, that the return value from the floor() function is a _double_ which we cannot use as an index into array L without error. 
//#We must first use another function to cast the _double_ to type _int_ to get the correct data type for an array index.#
#We must use a composition of functions (Java's floor() function followed by the function that casts an input of type _double_ to an output of type _int_) to get the correct data type for an array index.#

//Someone new to Java may be surprised by this since its easy to think that each int can be represented as a double, but the data type matters here.

//Notice that this informal definiton _does not specify_ whether each possible output value actually corresponds to an input value. 
//As an example, the squaring function $f(x) = x^{2}$ that takes any real number as an input value can only have nonegative real numbers as its output values, even though this function is often plotted in the _xy_-plane as if _any_ real number output is possible. For example, the squaring function is often compared to another function (e.g., a linear function that does have negative real numbers as output values) by plotting both functions.

.Definition
// MKD: This definition is based on/adapted from the definition of «fonction» given in N. Bourbaki. 1970. Théorie des ensembles. Éléments de mathématique. Springer.
A *function $f$ from set $A$ to set $B$* is an ordered triple $(f,\, A,\, B)$ consisting of sets $f,$ $A,$ and $B$ such that 

* $f$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $A \times B$ and 
* each element of $A$ 
//is associated with a unique element of _B._ 
appears as the first coordinate of exactly one pair $( a, \, b) \in f.$ 

That is, $f \subseteq A \times B$ and for each element $a \in A$ there is exactly one $b \in B$ such that $(a,\, b) \in f$. The set $f$ of ordered pairs is called the *graph* of the function. 
//; it is referred to as the *rule* of the function, also. 
The set $A$ is called the *domain* of the function and the set $B$ is called the *codomain* of the function. + 
[small]#Note: This definition of a function as an ordered triple is based on the  Bourbaki definition in the 1970 book

****


// MKD Jan 23 2025 inserted first sentence
Why would we need such a highly technical formal definition? 
#The reason why the ordered triple is used in the definition is that we need to be able to distinguish two functions that have the same graph, as a set of ordered pairs, 
//by specifying the codomain. 
but different codomains.# 
//Note that if two functions have the same graph then they must have the same domain, but they could still have different codomains.
// MKD Jan 23 2025 revision
// further rewording March 9 2025
Two functions can have different codomains even if their graphs, as sets of ordered pairs, are the same set (Notice that if two functions have the same graph then they must have the same domain.) If this is not clear, see the example "Three closely-related functions, no two of which are equal," which comes after the definitions listed below.

//MKD need example from R to R here to illustrate that the graph is what you typically plot as points in the _xy_-plane.

* We write $f : A \rightarrow B$ to state that $f$ is a function from set $A$ to set $B.$ 

* We often refer to the ordered triple as "_f_" without explicitly mentioning the other two members of the ordered triple. That is, 
we refer to the function as its set of ordered pairs $f$, 
//We often refer to a function $f : A \rightarrow B$ by only the letter $f$, 
but it is very important to remember that the actual definition includes the domain and codomain, too. 

* It is important to note that the graph of $f$ is the set of ordered pairs which we often represent by plotting points, but that plot is only a _representation_ of the graph (in the same way that "five" and "cinco" are verbal _representations_ of a number but are not the number itself.)  

* We write $f(a)=b$ instead of $(a,\, b) \in f$. The value $b = f(a)$ is called the *image of $a$* assigned by $f,$ and $a$ is called the *pre-image* of $b.$ 
//We also write $f: a \rightarrow  b$ to mean that $f(a)=b$. 

//MKD insert  f(C) = {f(a) | a \in C} where C is a subset of the domain A

* The *range* of $f$ is the set $\{ f(a) : a \in A \}$, that is, the set of all images (output values) assigned by $f.$ The range is the set of $b \in B$ such that there is _at least one_ ordered pair $( a, \, b) \in f.$ 

* Two functions are *equal* if they have the same graph, the same domain, and the same codomain. That is, the functions $(f,\, A,\, B)$ and $(g,\, S,\, T)$ are equal if they are identical as ordered triples: $f = g$ and $A = S$ and $B = T.$ 
//Two functions are *equal* (or simply "are the same function") if the ordered triples that define the two functions are equal. That is, two functions are equal if and only if they have the same set of ordered pairs for their graphs, the same domain, and the same codomain. 
We can also simply say that "$f$ and $g$ are the same function."

* Notice that the graph $f$ in the formal definition replaces the _rule_ used in the informal definition. Given the graph, which is the set of ordered pairs, we can state a rule as "given an input $a \in A,$ the output is the one $b \in B$ such that $(a,\, b) \in f.$"  
This is exactly how you would use a table of values to represent a function: Find the row with the input value then choose the value in the output column
// MKD insert image of function table.  
//without given a more precise equation, formula, or verbal description.

//MKD inserted the following
[IMPORTANT]
.The graph (i.e., the set of ordered pairs), the domain, and the codomain determine the function, NOT the formula, words, table, plot, or code  used to describe a rule for the function.
====
The graph of a function determines how to assign each input to its output.
// _NOT_ a formula, words, table, or plot used to describe how inputs are associated to outputs.   
//It does not matter _how_ the function is defined in terms of formulae, words, tables, or plots. 
//Two functions are the same (that is, are equal) if they have the same set of ordered pairs for their graphs, the same domain, and the same codomain. 
For example, the functions  
$f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$  and $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
defined by the formulae $f(x) = |x|$ and $g(x) = \sqrt(x^{2})$ are _equal,_ and in fact are _one and the same function,_ because $f = g$ as _sets,_ so the "two" functions have the same graph, the same domain, and the same codomain. The "two" functions are just two ways of describing the same ordered triple.

// MKD old floatyMcFloatFloor example begins
For example, the floor function, 
$f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor,$ the greatest integer less than or equal to $x,$ is treated as _a different function_ formally from the 
floor function $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $g(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor.$ Note that the graphs of $f$ and $g$, as defined in terms of the ordered triples, are the same set of ordered pairs, 
and that the same expression defines both $f(x)$ and $g(x),$ 
but for function $g$ every element in the codomain is also in the range, while that is not true for the function $f.$ For example, $\frac{1}{2}$ is in the codomain of $f$ but is not in the range of $f.$ 
You can think of the floor function $f$ as the one whose points you plot in the _xy_-plane, and the floor function $g$ as the one implemented in Python code in the following example; notice that the `math.floor()` function takes a `float` as input but returns an `int.` 
//instead of a `float.` 
A user-defined function 
that implements $f$ 
with an explicit cast of the return value to `float` is included in the example.

Notice in the Python code below that the return value from the `math.floor()` function is an `int` which can be used as an index into the list L, unlike the return value from the user-defined function. 

* Python's built-in `float` is a double precision floating-point type.
* The user-defined function is more like (but not exactly the same as) Java's  `Math.floor()` which returns a `double` instead of an `int`.

//== Injective, Surjective, Bijective, and Inverse Functions
== Properties of Functions

In this subsection you will learn about several properties of functions.

=== Injective Functions

A function $f : A \rightarrow B$ is *injective* if distinct elements of the domain $A$ are mapped to distinct elements of the range. 
// in the range is associated with a unique element from the domain $A.$ 
That is, for all $a_1$ and $a_2$ in $A,$ if $a_1 \neq a_2$ then $f(a_1) \neq f(a_2).$ 
//That is, different input elements of $A$ have different output images in $B$. 
//This means that if $f(m)=b$ and $f(n)=b$, then necessarily $m=n$. + 
Using the contrapositive, this can be stated as: For all $a_1$ and $a_2$ in $A,$ if $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ then $a_1 = a_2.$ + 
[small]#Note: Injective functions are also called *one to one* functions.  The Remix avoids this term because it is easy to confuse "one to one function" with "one-to-one correspondence."#

****
.Example {counter:funcex} - Injective Functions

Consider the functions + 
$f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ defined by $f(n) = 2^{n}$ + 
$g : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $g(n) = n^{2},$ and + 
$h : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $h(n) = n + 2,$ and + 
$k : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $k(n) = \frac{1}{4}((-1)^n (2n+1) - 1).$

$f$ is injective because different input values must be mapped to different output values. Notice that $f(a) = f(c)$ means that $2^{a} = 2^{c}$ from which $2^{a} / 2^{c} = 1 = 2^{a-c}$ must be True, so $a-c = 0$ must be True, that is, $a = c.$

$g$ is not injective because the input values $2$ and $-2$ are mapped to the same output value: $(2)^2 = 4$ and $(-2)^2 = 4.$

$h$ is injective because $h(a) = h(c)$ means that $a+2 = c+2,$ which means that $a=c.$ 

$k$ is not injective because the input values $-1$ and $0$ are mapped to the same output value, 0.

// MKD March 9 2025 - commented out
Real-valued functions, $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, that are strictly
increasing or strictly decreasing, such as exponential or logarithmic functions,  are injective.

.Theorem on real valued functions
****
A real-valued function, $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, that is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing is injective.
****

Informally a function is *injective* if different elements in the domain are mapped to different elements in the range. A function is  *not injective* if at least _two different elements_ are mapped to the _same element_
in the range.
[NOTE]
====
On a Cartesian plane, this means that _every_ horizontal line intersects
the graph _at most once_ for an injective function.  A function is not injective if _at least one_ horizontal line intersects the graph _more than once_.
//MKD ADD GRAPH SHOWING NOT INJECTIVE
====
////

=== Surjective Functions

A function $f$ from the set $A$ to the set $B$ is *surjective* if the image set of $A$ is the entire set $B$. This means than for each element $b$ in the codomain $B,$ there is some element $a \in A$ with $f(a)=b$. + 
[small]#Note: Surjective functions are also called *onto* functions.#

****
.Example {counter:funcex} - Surjective Functions

Consider the functions + 
$f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ defined by $f(n) = 2^{n}$ + 
$g : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $g(n) = n^{2},$ and + 
$h : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $h(n) = n + 2,$ and + 
$k : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $k(n) = \frac{1}{4}((-1)^n (2n+1) - 1).$

$f$ is not surjective since it is not possible for $2^{n}$ to have a value that is less than or equal to 0.

$g$ is not surjective because is not possible for $n^{2}$ to have a value that is less than 0.

$h$ is surjective because every $b$ in the codomain $\mathbb{Z}$ is an output for some input: Notice that $h(b-2) = (b-2+2) = 2.$ 

$k$ is surjective because every $b$ in the codomain $\mathbb{Z}$ is an output for some nonnegative input - for inputs $n \geq 0,$ the outputs $k(n)$ are shown in the lower row of the image.

//image::imagesMKD/NtoZ.png[NtoZ,992,294,float="right",align="center"]
image::imagesMKD/NtoZ.png[NtoZ,331,98,align="center"]

****

Notice that whether a function is surjective depends on what the function's codomain. This is, again, why the formal definition of function is needed.

////
// MKD March 9 2025 - commented out
Informally a function is *surjective* to its codomain $B$, if _every_ element in $B$
can be reached
by $f$. A function is  *not surjective*  to its codomain if at least
_one element_ in the co-domain is not in the range or in the image set of $f$.
[NOTE]
====
On a Cartesian plane,
this means that _every_ horizontal line intersects
the graph _at least once_ for a surjective function.
A function is not surjective if
_there is_ a horizontal line  that _does not intersect_ the graph.
//MKD ADD GRAPH SHOWING NOT SURJECTIVE
====
****
.Example {counter:funcex} - injective but not surjective.

Explain why the real-valued exponential function $f(x)=2^x$ is injective, but not surjective,
from $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

.Solution

For injectivity, notice that the exponential function $f(x)=2^x$ is strictly
increasing, as can be seen from its graph.
Every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once, meaning that if $2^m =2^n$, then
necessarily $m=n$.

For surjectivity, notice that $f(x)=2^x$, is strictly positive $(0,\infty)$ so its range is not all real numbers. As a specific,
example, there is no real $x$, for which $f(x) = 2^x =-1$. The $y-$ value $y=-1$ is not reached by any
real $x$.  We conclude that $f(x)=2^x$, with
$f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, is injective, but not
surjective, from $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

****


****
.Example {counter:funcex}- neither injective nor surjective

Explain why the real-valued exponential function $f(x)=x^2$ is neither injective
nor surjective, from $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

.Solution
Notice from the graph of $f(x)=x^2$, that the range is only non-negative numbers.
This means that negative numbers cannot be reached. The function $f(x)=x^2$ is
not surjective, from $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. In particular there is no real,
$x$, for which, for example, $f(x)=x^2 =-1$.

Also notice that $f(2)=4$, and $f(-2)=4$, but $2 \neq -2$, which means the function is not
injective. A horizontal line at $y=4$, meets the graph at both $x=2$, and $x=-2$.


****
////


=== Bijective Functions

A function $f$ is *bijective* if it is both injective and surjective.
// MKD state that bijective is "same as"  1-1 correspondence


////
// MKD March 9 2025 - commented out
****
.Example {counter:funcex} - A bijective function

Explain why the function $f(x)=x^3$, from $f:R\rightarrow R$, is bijective.

.Solution

We need to show that the function is both injective and surjective.
Notice from the graph of $f(x)=x^3$ that the domain and codomain are
both all real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$. Every real number $b$ can be reached because
$f(x)=x^3 =b$, has asciimath:[x=root(3)(b)]. For example $-27$ is mapped to by $-3$,
because $f(-3)=(-3)^3 = -27$, and $64$, is mapped to by $4$ because $f(4)=(4)^3 = 64$.
This may also be confirmed  from the graph of $f(x)=x^3$, by noticing that
every horizontal line meets the graph at least once.

For injectivity, notice that the graph of $f(x)=x^3$, that the function is strictly
increasing.
This means that if $a^3=b^3$, then necessarily $a=b$. In fact if $a^3=b^3=c$, then,
$a=b=$ asciimath:[ root(3)(c)], uniquely.

****
////

****
.Example {counter:funcex} - Verifying a function is bijective

Verify that the function $f\left(x\right)=3x+5$, from $f:R\rightarrow R$, is bijective.

.Solution

For injectivity, suppose $f\left(m\right)=f(n)$. We want to show $m=n$.

$f\left(m\right)=f(n)$

$3m+5=3n+5$

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives $3m=3n$, and then multiplying both sides by
$\frac{1}{3}$ gives $m=n$.

To show that $f\left(x\right)$ is surjective we need to
show that any $c\in R$ can be reached by  $f\left(x\right)$.
Specifically, to show that $f\left(x\right)$ is surjective, we need to show that for any
$c\in R$, there is a corresponding $x$ for which $f\left(x\right)=c$.  To show this
consider $f\left(x\right)=3x+5$. Equate to $c$ and solve for $x$.

$f\left(x\right)=3x+5=c$

Well,    $3x+5=c$ gives $3x=c-5$ or $ x=\frac{c-5}{3}$.  So, for any $c$, there is an $x$, namely
$x=\frac{c-5}{3}$, for which $f\left(x\right)=c$.
****


// MKD March 9 2025 - new section for Invertible functions
== Inverse Functions

Informally, a function $f$ is invertible if each $b$ in the codomain $B$ is assigned to exactly one input $a$ in the domain $A.$ 

Formally, a function $f : A \rightarrow  B$ is *invertible* if the ordered triple $(\{(b, a) \, | \, (a, b) \in f \},\, B,\, A)$ is a function. 

The set $\{(b, a) \, | \, (a, b) \in f \}$ is usually denoted by $f^{-1}$ even in cases when $f$ is not invertible.

//inverse of relation $f : A \rightarrow  B$ is from set $A$ to set $B$* is an ordered triple $(f,\, A,\, B)$ consisting of sets $f,$ $A,$ and $B$ such that 

//A function $f$ is *invertible* if the inverse of relation $f : A \rightarrow  B$ is also a function. The inverse is usually denoted $ f^{-1}$.

For example if $(a,b)$, corresponds to $f(a)=b$ , then $ f^{-1}:  B \rightarrow  A$, corresponds to $ f^{-1}(b)=a$.

The following theorem shows that invertibility of a function is equivalent to bijectivity, or a function being both injective and surjective.

.Theorem on Invertibility
****
A function $f: A \rightarrow  B$ is invertible if and only if $f$ is bijective.
****

[NOTE]
====
Being able to solve an equation, amounts to being able to invert a function.
Notationally, solving $f(x) =b$ means solving for $x$.

Using inverses $f(x) =b$ is solved $x=f^{-1}\left(b\right)$.
====

Consider, for example, $f\left(x\right)=x^3$ we know
[asciimath]
++++
 f^{\left(-1\right)}\left(x\right)=root(3)(x)
++++

Solving $f\left(x\right)=2$ means solving $x^3=2$.
To solve  $f\left(x\right)=2$, we use  $x=f^{-1}\left(8\right)$, which
in this case means,
[asciimath]
++++
 x=f^{-1}\left(8\right)=root(3)(8) = 2
++++
An easy check $ f\left(2\right)=2^3=8$ and
[asciimath]
++++
 f^{-1}\left(8\right)=root(3)(8) = 2
++++

Functions can, in many cases, be visualized graphically.
 For example when mapping from the real line $\mathbb{R}$
to the real line such maps are viewed on a Cartesian plane.

== The Ceiling, Floor, Maximum and  Minimum Functions

There are two important rounding functions, the ceiling function and the floor function. In discrete
math often we need to round a real number to a discrete integer.

=== The Ceiling Function

The ceiling, $f(x)=\lceil x\rceil$, function rounds up $x$ to the nearest integer.

The *ceiling function*, used to compute the ceiling of $x$,
denoted, $ f(x)=\lceil x \rceil $ gives the smallest integer
_greater than or equal to_ $x$.

For example,   $ \lceil 3.4 \rceil =4$ and  $ \lceil 3.7 \rceil =4$.


=== The Floor Function

The floor $ f(x)=\lfloor x \rfloor $, rounds down $x$ to the nearest integer.

The *floor function*, used to compute the floor of $x$, denoted $ f(x)=\lfloor x \rfloor $,
gives the greatest integer _less than or equal to_ $x$.

For
example,$ \lfloor 3.4 \rfloor =3$ and  $ \lfloor 3.7 \rfloor =3$.


The graphs of the ceiling ($ \lceil x\rceil$)and floor ($ \lfloor x \rfloor $)
functions are shown below.

****
.Example {counter:funcex}

Explain why the floor function, $ f(x)=\lfloor x \rfloor $, from the real line to the set of all integers,
is surjective but not injective.

.Solution

For surjectivity, notice that the range, and co-domain is, $\mathbb{Z}$, the set of
all real numbers. Also for
any integer, $m$, $ f(m)=\lfloor m \rfloor =m$, meaning that every integer, $m$, is reached, or
obtained by the floor function, $ f(x)=\lfloor x \rfloor $.

For injectivity, notice that multiple numbers are rounded down to the same integer.  For example,
$ f(3.4)=\lfloor 3.4 \rfloor =3 $, and $ f(3.7)=\lfloor 3.7 \rfloor =3 $, so
that $f(3.4)=f(3.7)$,
but $3.4 \neq 3.7$

=== The Max Function

The function $h\left(x\right)=\max{\left(f\left(x\right)\right)},\ g(x))$
is evaluated at each $x$ for which both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined
by the function

latexmath:[
h(x) =\max(f(x),g(x)) = \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 f(x) \\
 g(x)
\end{array}
\right.
\begin{array}{c}
 \text{if } f(x)\text{  }\geq g(x) \\
 \text{if } f(x) < g(x)
\end{array}
]

So for example if $f(x) =\ \sqrt x$, and $g(x) =x^2$ then $h(x)=\max(f(x),g(x))$,
has
$h(1/4)  =\max$
$ \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}},\ \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2\right) $
$=max\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{16}\right)=\frac{1}{2}$,
and   $h(4) =\max$ $\left(\sqrt4,\ 4^2\right)=\max(2,16)=16$.
The graph of $h(x) =\max(\sqrt x,\ x^2)$ over the interval $(0,2)$ is shown below.

****
=== The Min Function

The function $h(x) =\min(f(x),g(x))$ is evaluated at each $x$ for which both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined
and is similar to the $max$ function, but is defined by the minimum of $f(x)$, and $g(x)$ at each $x$.


latexmath:[
h(x) =\min(f(x),g(x)) = \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 f(x) \\
 g(x)
\end{array}
\right.
\begin{array}{c}
 \text{if } f(x)\text{  }\leq g(x) \\
 \text{if } f(x) > g(x)
\end{array}
]

So for example if $f(x) =\ \sqrt x$, and $g(x) =x^2$ then $h(x)=\min(f(x),g(x))$,
has
$h(1/4)  =\min$
$ \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}},\ \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2\right) $
$=\min\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{16}\right)=\frac{1}{16}$,
and   $h(4) =\min$ $\left(\sqrt4,\ 4^2\right)=\min(2,16)=2$.



The graph of $h(x) =min(\sqrt x,\ x^2)$ over the interval $[0,2] $, is shown below

== The Algebra of Functions

If two functions $f\left(x\right)$ and $g\left(x\right)$
have the same domain $A$ and same codomain $\mathbb{R},$ then you can combine these functions using the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

.The Algebra of Functions
****
.. $\left(f+g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)+g\left(x\right)$
.. $\left(f-g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)-g\left(x\right)$
.. $\left(f\cdot\ g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)\cdot\ g\left(x\right)$
.. $\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)\left(x\right)=\frac{f\left(x\right)}{g\left(x\right)},\ \ g\left(x\right)\neq0$

****

.Example {counter:funcex}

Consider $f\left(x\right)=x^2+1$ and $g\left(x\right)=\sqrt x$ defined on $f,\ g: \mathbb{R}_{\geq0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. 
Find the rules for the functions $\left(f+g\right)$, $\left(f-g\right)$, $\left(f\cdot\ g\right)$,  and $\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)?$

.Solution

The common domain is $\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$, since the square root is real valued only for $\ x\ \geq0$.

$\left(f+g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)+g\left(x\right)=x^2+1+\sqrt x$ , for $ x  ≥  0$


$\left(f-g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)-g\left(x\right)=x^2+1- \sqrt x$ ,  for $ x  ≥  0$

$\left(f\cdot\ g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)\cdot\ g\left(x\right)=\left(x^2+1\right)\cdot\ \sqrt x$,
for $ x  ≥  0$

$\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)\left(x\right)=\frac{f\left(x\right)}{g\left(x\right)}=\frac{x^2+1\cdot\ }{\ \sqrt x}$,
for $ x  >  0$.

Notice that the domain of $\frac{f}{g}$ is $x>0$, because $g\left(0\right)=\sqrt0=0$,
and division by $0$ is not defined.

****

== Composition of Functions

Suppose $g:A\rightarrow B$ and $f:B\rightarrow C$,
then the functions $ f$ and $g$, can be *composed* to obtain a function
$h:A\rightarrow C$, denoted as follows,

$h\left(x\right)=\left(f\circ g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)$
provided $x\ \in\ A$ and $g\left(x\right)\in B$.

// MKD Sept 4 2024 changed second function h to k
****
.Example {counter:funcex}

Consider $f\left(x\right)=\frac{1}{x}$ and $g\left(x\right)=2x-3$,
defined on $f,g:R\rightarrow R$. Notice that $g\left(x\right)$
is defined for all real $x$ and $f\left(x\right)$ is defined for all real $x\ \neq0$. Form the compositions,
$h\left(x\right)=\left(f \circ g\right)\left(x\right)$, and
$k\left(x\right)=\left(g \circ f\right)\left(x\right)$. Also determine their respective domains.

.Solution

$h\left(x\right)=\left(f \circ g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)=f\left(2x-3\right)=\frac{1}{2x-3}$.
Here $x$ needs to be in the domain of $g\left(x\right)$,  or all real $x$,
and $g\left(x\right)$ needs to be in the domain of $f\left(x\right)$.
In particular $g\left(x\right)\neq 0$, or $2x-3\ \neq 0$,   or $x\ \neq\frac{3}{2}$.

By contrast,  $k\left(x\right)=\left(g\circ f\right)\left(x\right)=g\left(f\left(x\right)\right)=g\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=2\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)-3=\frac{2}{x}-3$.
Here $x$ needs to be in the domain of $f\left(x\right)$, or $x\ \neq 0$, and $f\left(x\right)$
needs to be in the domain of $g\left(x\right)$, or $f\left(x\right)$ can be any real number.

.Example {counter:funcex} - composing inverse functions

Consider $f\left(x\right)=x^3+1$ and  asciimath:[g(x) =root(3)(x-1)]
defined on on $f,g:R\rightarrow R$.
Show that $\left(g \circ f\right)\left(1\right)=1, \left(g \circ f\right)\left(2\right)=2, \left(g\circ f\right)\left(3\right)=3$,
and $\left(g\circ f\right)\left(x\right)=x$

.Solution
$f\left(1\right)=1^3+1=2$

$f\left(2\right)=2^3+1=9$

$f\left(3\right)=3^3+1=28$

$f\left(x\right)=x^3+1$



Therefore,

$ \left(g\circ f\right)\left(1\right)=g\left(f\left(1\right)\right)=g\left(2\right)=$ asciimath:[ root(3)(2-1)= root(3)(1)=1]

$\left(g\circ f\right)\left(2\right)=g\left(f\left(2\right)\right)=g\left(9\right)=$ asciimath:[ root(3)(9-1)= root(3)(8)=2]

$\left(g\circ f\right)\left(3\right)=g\left(f\left(3\right)\right)=g\left(28\right)=$ asciimath:[ root(3)(28-1)= root(3)(27)=3]

$\left(g\circ f\right)\left(x\right)=g\left(f\left(x\right)\right)=g\left(x^3+1\ \right)=$asciimath:[ root(3)(x^3 +1 -1)= root(3)(x^3 )=x]
****

Notice, in the last example, that $g\left(x\right)$ undoes $f\left(x\right)$, in the following sense:

$f:1\rightarrow 2$   and  $g:2\rightarrow 1$, or the ordered pair $\left(1,2\right)$
in $f$, corresponds to $\left(2,1\right)$ for $g$.

$f:2\rightarrow 9$  and  $g:9\rightarrow 2$, or the ordered pair $\left(2,9\right)$,
in $f$, corresponds to $\left(9,2\right)$ for $g$.

$f:3\rightarrow 28$  and  $g:28\rightarrow 3$, or the ordered pair $\left(3,28\right)$,
in $f$, corresponds to $\left(28,3\right)$ for $g$.

$f:x\rightarrow x^3+1$  and  $g:x^3+1\rightarrow x$, or the ordered pair $\left(x,x^3+1\right)$,
in $f$, corresponds to $\left(x^3+1,x\right)$ for $g$.

The function asciimath:[ g(x))= root(3)(x-1) ]  is said to be the inverse of the function $f\left(x\right)=x^3+1$.
We have shown explicitly that $\left(g\circ f\right)\left(x\right)=x$.

//== The Inverse of a Function
// MKD March 9 2025 reworked this subsection
=== Inverse Functions and Composition

Notice that if you happen to have two functions $f : A \rightarrow B$ and  $g : B \rightarrow A$ such that 
$(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = a$ for every $a \in A$ and
$(f \circ g)(b) = f(g(b)) = b$ for every $b \in B,$ then $f$ and $g$ are inverse functions. 

//In view of this relation when composing functions that are inverses of each other, we provide an intuitive definition of inverse functions.

//Suppose $f\left(a\right):A\rightarrow B$ is bijective, then the *inverse* of $f\left(x\right)$, is the function denoted $f^{-1}\left(b\right):B\rightarrow A$.

//The inverse can be similarly defined for relations in general, however the bijective property is used to ensure that the inverse of a function $f$ is also a function.

//For example the following relations have inverses as given.

//$\left\{\left(-3,\ 9\right),\ \left(-2,4\right),\ \left(-1,1\right),\ \left(0,0\right),\ \left(1,\ 1\right),\ \left(2,\ 4\right),\ \left(3,9\right)\right\}$ with inverse,

//$\left \{ \left(9,-3\ \right),\ \left(4,\ -2\ \right),\ \left(1,\ -1\right),\ \left(0,0\right),\ (1,\ 1,\ \left(4,2,\right),\ (9,3)\right \}$


//Notice that the original relation can be considered a function with domain $A=\left\{-3,\ -2,\ -1,\ 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\right\}$ and co-domain $B=\left\{0,\ 1,\ 4,\ 9\right\}$.  However the inverse mapping from domain $A=\left\{0,\ 1,\ 4,\ 9\right\}$ with co-domain $B=\left\{-3,\ -2,\ -1,\ 0,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\right\}$, is a relation that is not a function because of the mappings $\left(-9,3\right)$, and $\left(-9,\ 3\right)$.


****
.Example {counter:funcex} - finding an inverse

Find the inverse $g\left(x\right)$ of  the bijective function
$f\left(x\right)=3x+5$ for $f,\ g:R\rightarrow R$ .  Verify the inverse and show $\left(f \circ g\right)\left(x\right)=x=\left(g \circ f\right)\left(x\right)$.

Show specifically that $f\left(2\right)=11$, and $g\left(11\right)=2$.

.Solution

If $f:x\rightarrow y$ corresponds to $(x,y)$, then the inverse  $g:y\rightarrow x$
corresponds to $(y,x)$. This means that the inverse of the relation
$y=f\left(x\right)=3x+5$, is the relation $x=f\left(y\right)=3y+5$.

Solving for $y$ in $x=f\left(y\right)$, gives $f^{-1}(x)=y$.
Solving for $y$ in  $x=f\left(y\right)=3y+5$, gives $x-5=3y$ or
$\frac{x-5}{3}=y=\ f^{-1}(x)=g(x)$.

We now verify that $\left(f\circ g\right)\left(x\right)=x=\left(g \circ f\right)\left(x\right)$.

$\left(f\circ g\right)\left(x\right)=f\left(\frac{x-5}{3}\right)=\ 3\left(\frac{x-5}{3}\right)+5=\left(x-5\right)+5=x$,

and
$\left(g \circ f\right)\left(x\right)=g\left(3x+5\right)=\ \frac{(3x+5)-5}{3}=\frac{3x+5-5}{3}=\frac{3x}{3}=x$.

Finally $f\left(x\right)=3x+5$, and $f\left(2\right)=3\left(2\right)+5=6+5=11$,
or $f:2\rightarrow 11$

and
$g\left(x\right)=\frac{x-5}{3}$  and ,  $g\left(11\right)=\frac{11-5}{3}=\frac{6}{3}=2$
or $g:11\rightarrow 2$.
