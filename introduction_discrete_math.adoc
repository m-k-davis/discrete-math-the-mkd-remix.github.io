= Introducing Discrete Mathematics

// OMITTED FOR NOW - NEEDS MAJOR EDITING
////
MKD: These Course Objectives are the same as the ones in the front matter of the original text; see https://github.com/ggc-discrete-math/ggc-discrete-math.github.io/blob/main/front_matter.html
== Course Objectives

At Georgia Gwinnett College, students who have successfully completed the Discrete Mathematics course will,

. Reason mathematically and use mathematical language appropriately to demonstrate an understanding of comprehending and constructing mathematical arguments.
. Perform combinatorial analysis to solve counting problems and analyze algorithms.
. Demonstrate an understanding of discrete structures including sets, permutations, relations, graphs, and trees.
. Demonstrate algorithmic thinking using mathematical creativity and critical thinking by specifying algorithms, verifying that algorithms work, and analyzing the time required to perform specific algorithms.
. Use appropriate technology in the evaluation, analysis, and synthesis of information in problem-solving situations.

These course goals help structure the content of this class, which is
aimed at students of
information technology, computer science, and applied mathematics.  The focus is on applying
discrete math techniques from the two broad component areas of discrete
math, namely
combinatorics or enumerative techniques, and graph theory.

To that end, algorithmic thinking figures
prominently in this course.
Designing algorithms, particularly algorithms
applied to networks, involves the use of graph theory methods. Implementing algorithms
requires a careful understanding of logical structures, and usually a top down implementation
approach, beginning with a specifications description,  and then proceeding
to a pseudocode implementation and finally a language dependent coding
implementation. Moreover, analyzing the complexity of algorithms requires a knowledge of functions,
the growth of functions, and counting techniques from combinatorial analysis.  Similarly, mathematical induction and recursive
definitions are used in a cohesive way to understand algorithms and the options in implementing these
recursively versus iteratively.

The approach we take is one with an integrative incorporation of programming and
algorithms into the course. The aim is to help improve students success
with their broad programming curricula in courses like Intermediate and Advanced Programming.

== Basics 
//This section informally introduces some basic foundational mathematical concepts that will be used throughout the book. These concepts will be discussed much more formally later in the textbook.

Here is an informal introduction to some basic foundational mathematical concepts that will be used throughout the book. These concepts will be discussed much more formally later in the textbook.

* A *set* is an unordered collection of zero or more objects. You can think of a set as a list of names of the objects, where the list may contain duplicate entries and may be unsorted. 
// not be sorted in any particular way, BUT we 
We only care whether an object's name is in the list -  we do not care where in the list the name appears or how many times the name appears in the list. An example is the set of the names of the additive primary colors of light which can be written as $\{ \text{"red"},\,\text{"green"},\,\text{"blue"},\,\text{"red"} \}$ which contains exactly three elements: "red", "green", and "blue". 

** NOTE: 
//Mathematical 
In mathematics, sets like $\{ \text{"red"},\,\text{"green"},\,\text{"blue"},\,\text{"red"} \}$ are  _constants_ - once a set has been defined and described you cannot change the set by removing elements or inserting new elements. As an example, $\text{"yellow"}$ [.underline]#cannot# be inserted into the old set $\{ \text{"red"},\,\text{"green"},\,\text{"blue"},\,\text{"red"} \}$ defined above, but we [.underline]#can# define a _new set_ $\{ \text{"red"},\,\text{"green"},\,\text{"blue"},\,\text{"red"},\,\text{"yellow"} \}$ that contains four elements by appending $\text{"yellow"}$ to the end of the list used to define the old set.

//* In this book, the *natural numbers*, denoted by the letter $\mathbb{N}$, is the set of _nonnegative integers_ $\{ 0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots \}$. Be careful when looking at other books or sources on the internet - some of them may define the natural numbers to be the same as the positive integers.

// MKD NOTE ON NATURAL NUMBERS: Both "Rosen" and "Haggard, Schlipf, and Whitesides" define the natural numbers as $\{ 0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots \}$ 
// MKD ISO 80000-2 ALSO DEFINES NATURAL NUMBERS TO INCLUDE 0
// "ISO" is the International Organization for Standardization
//A *natural number* is one of the _nonnegative integers_.
* #A *natural number* is one of the _nonnegative integers_.# 
The letter $\mathbb{N}$ denotes the set of natural numbers, that is, $\mathbb{N} = \{ 0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots \}$ 
//(The three dots are used because the list is infinite, but we cannot write out an infinite list). 
where the three dots are used because we cannot write down the entire,  infinitely-long list of natural numbers. 
** WARNING: Be careful when looking at other sources (older books or websites) - 
most use the standardized definition of "natural numbers" that is used in this textbook, but a few may define a natural number to be a positive integer.
//some use the same definition of "natural number" as this textbook does, but others may define natural numbers to be positive integers.

//MKD Move discussion of primes to later Chapter?
* A positive integer $n$ that is greater than $1$ is called *prime* if the only positive integer factors of $n$ are $1$ and $n$ itself, and is called *composite* otherwise. For example, $2$ is prime since its set of positive integer factors is $\{ 1,\,2 \}$, but $6$ is composite since its set of positive integer factors is $\{ 1,\,2,\,3,\,6 \}$. 
** NOTE: #The integer $1$ is considered neither prime nor composite.# The reason for this is beyond the scope of this textbook but would be discussed in a more advanced math course in _ring theory_.


* A *function* is a rule that assigns to each valid input exactly one output value. The set of valid input values is called the _domain_ and the set that contains the output values is called the _codomain_ (The _range_ is the set that contains only the output values and no other elements).
One example of a function is described by 
//"Return the first character of the unicode string that is typed by the user." Another example is described by "Return the concatenation of 'Hello, ' and the name typed in by the user." 
"Return the first character of the input string." 
Another example is described by "Return the concatenation of 'Hello, ' and the input string." 
Other examples, described by mathematical formulae, are $f(n) = n^{2}$, $g(x,\,y) = xy + y$, and $h(z) = 2z+1$.

// MKD AFTER MAY 24 2024 Maybe move one-to-one correspondence immediately after sets and define as a pairing (then mention under functions that one-to-one correspondences are specific examples of functions)

* A *one-to-one correspondence* between two sets $A$ and $B$ is a function with domain $A$ and range $B$ such that every output value in $B$ corresponds to exactly one input value. That is, a one-to-one correspondence pairs each member of the set $A$ with exactly one member of set $B$, and pairs each member of set $B$ with exactly one member of set $A$
//: Each member of the domain appears in exactly one pair. 
For example, the function that assigns each uppercase English letter to its corresponding lowercase English letter is a one-to-one correspondence between 
the set of uppercase English letters 
//$\{ "A",\,"B",\,"C",\,\ldots,\,"X",\,"Y",\,"Z" \}$ and 
$\{ \text{"A","B","C",...,"X","Y","Z"} \}$ and 
the set of lowercase English letters 
//$\{ "a",\,"b",\,"c",\,\ldots,\,"x",\,"y",\,"z" \}$.
$\{ \text{"a","b","c",...,"x","y","z"} \}$.

* *Summation notation* is used to abbreviate a _finite_ sum of numbers that contains a large number of addends. As an example, the sum $1+3+5+7+9+11+13+15+17+19$ can be abbreviated as $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{9}(2i+1)$. Likewise, 
the sum of the first $500$ positive odd integers,  
$1+3+5+\ldots+995+997+999$, can be abbreviated as  $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{499}(2i+1)$. 

** NOTE 1: The variable $i$ is commonly used in summation notation and is called the _index of summation_. We substitute each integer value for $i$, starting with the lower limit and stopping at the upper limit, into the algebraic expression or function written to the right of the capital Greek letter $\sum$, which is called "sigma". This index of summation $i$ has nothing to do with the complex number constant $i$ - Mathematicians recycle and reuse letters!

** NOTE 2: "Infinite sums," more properly called _infinite series_, are not discussed in this discrete mathematics textbook. Each infinite series is defined as the limit of sequences of partial (finite) sums, and "limits" is a topic from continuous mathematics, not discrete mathematics.
// involving properties of the real numbers.

* A *statement* is a finite number of words, symbols, etc., that express human communication. For example, "The previous sentence contained more than three words" is a statement. Other examples of statements are "$2 + 2 = 5$" and "Some positive integers are prime." 
Two statements are *equivalent* if the first must be true when the second one is true AND the second must be true when the first one is true. 

* A *predicate* is an incomplete statement that contains one or more variables that need to be filled in. Two examples are 
"My major is $\rule{3mm}{.1pt}$." 
and 
"The positive integer $n$ is a prime number." 
We will often use notation that is similar to function notation: $P(n)$ = "The positive integer $n$ is a prime number."
Two predicates are *equivalent* if the first must be true when the second one is true AND the second must be true when the first one is true. 

* A *bitstring* is a finite sequence of _bits_ (that is the binary digits 0 and 1). Bitstrings can be used to represent a sequence of answers to "No-Yes" or "False-True" questions. Bitstrings can also be used to represent numbers in _binary notation_ as in the example "There are 10 kinds of people in this world — those who understand binary and those who don’t."
//MKD maybe say a bit more about binary notation vs. decimal notation

* The *multiplication principle* (also called the *product rule*) is a basic counting technique. Suppose that we have a procedure that consists of completing two steps, that there are $k$ possible ways to complete the first step, and for each possible way of completing the first step, there are $m$ possible ways to complete the second step, then there are $k \cdot m$ ways to complete the two steps. As an example, the number of ways to construct a two-character string whose first character is one of the 26 uppercase letters from the English alphabet and whose second character is one of the 10 Hindu-Arabic numerals is $26 \cdot 10$ or $260$.

* A *(vertex-edge) graph* is a mathematical object that consists of vertices connnected by edges. In the example below, there are $6$ vertices and $7$ edges. Unlike a geometric figure, each edge only contains its endpoints,that is, edges are just connectors between endpoints and locations/points along an edge are ignored.

The design of this book is to introduce each concept informally, as was done above for the basic concepts, then notice properties and patterns, generalize what has been noticed, and formalize the ideas to prepare for even deeper analysis.


== Just-In-Time Appendices
Two appendices to this textbook contain additional mathematics that you may need to review as you work your way through the textbook. 

In addition, this book contains code snippets written in Python that are designed to aid your understanding of the mathematical concepts. 
One of the appendices introduces some (but not all) basic concepts from the Python programming language - the goal is to learn _"just enough Python"_ to be able to examine, run, and alter the existing code snippets. 
You are NOT expected to know the Python programming language before you start this course, and it is NOT one of the goals for you to master Python during this course.

 

//MKD: NEED TO EDIT ALL ORIGINAL TEXT BELOW.

== Applications of Discrete Mathematics

Remixer's Note: This section is taken from the original https://ggc-discrete-math.github.io/index.html[“Discrete Math”] book, with only a few minor edits.

Discrete mathematics is applied in many areas including the physical, engineering, and increasingly,
the social sciences.

=== Applications to Applied Mathematics

Most  problems that involve computational methods,
need to be solved using computers.  Rather than solve for the
temperature map of an entire planar region, we solve for
the temperature using a discrete set of mesh or grid of points on a
representative subset of the planar region.

.Continuous temperature profile versus discrete meshed representation on computer

image::images/temperature_distribution.png[]

=== Applications to Information Technology and Computer Science

Discrete mathematics is needed for computer science as
information and data is  stored digitally. Digitally
represented data is inherently discrete and is processed
using discrete methods.  For example a course grid discrete
representation of the 2-d temperature distribution from the plate above
could be:

latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}1&1&1\\2&4&8\\3&9&27\\4&16&64\\5&25&125\\\end{matrix}\right)
]

A voter registry may have voters in a database accessible from a list:

latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}John\ Smith\\Raheem\ Johnson\\.\\.\\.\\Sarah\ Muller\\\end{matrix}\right)
]

Which may need to be accessed and sorted, say geographically or alphabetically.


=== Applications to Data Science

Data science solutions to many problems use machine learning algorithms that
are inherently discrete in nature. The information that needs processing is discrete,
as are
the basic problems in data science such as classification or clustering problems. In particular

* Information consisting of data sets is represented using various data
structures including graphical structures such as trees.
Data science methods and algorithms involve procedures that
manipulate these graphical structures to, for example, networks,
classification trees, and decision trees.

* Classification problems are discrete in nature.
Classifying tumors as malignant or as benign involves trying to predict
if a variable $Y$ that we can think of as taking on two values either $0$ or $1$
either malignant or benign. There are various
algorithms used in  classification problems, such as the binary tumor
classification, including methods from probability.

.Binary classification algorithm ("1" malignant, "0" benign)

image::images/classification.png[]


=== Applications to Engineering

Digital signal processing involves taking a video,
audio, or other signal like temperature, pressure,
position and velocity, which is continuous, digitizing it and then
processing the digital signal mathematically.

.Continous vs discrete time signal
image::images/signal_processing.png[]

=== Applications of Combinatorics

*Combinatorics* involves in part the study of counting the number
of objects, satisfying a specified condition, from sets of
variable size. Enumeration and combinatorics is important in many
areas and examples including:

* Calculating the number of steps an algorithm needs to
process a data set of variable size $𝑛$. This problem is called the
computational cost  of the algorithm as a function of $𝑛$.
* Calculating the possible number of codes in a cryptographic code system

=== Applications of Graph Theory

*Graph theory*, which is the study of structures constructed with nodes
and the edges joining them, has applications in many fields including,

* _Chemistry_ -
representing molecular bonding and structure

.Graph theory and molecular bonding

image::images/molecular_bonding.png[]

* _Information technology and computer science_ - ranking pages on the internet,
with pages considered as nodes and page links as edges.

.Page ranks using a graph theory model.

image::images/page_ranking.png[]

* _Industrial engineering and network optimization_

** Traffic routes (computer, internet, air, highway, subway systems)
can be represented with stations as nodes and connections as edges.

** Often we are interested in finding an optimal path in a network such as in the following example,
finding the shortest tour over a series of towns on a map.

An example of the shortest tour problem, is shown below,
using a software solution.

.Using software like Mathematica to solve a network optimization problem such as finding the shortest tour.

image::images/shortest_tour.png[]


=== Applications of Probability and Statistics
Many probability assignments are based on counting and combinatorial methods.

* If we assume that the likelihood of rain is the same on any day
in the month of September, we might be interested in the probability that
it rains on $0$ days, it rains on exactly $1$ day, exactly $2$ days, etc.
Such probability assignments are called discrete distributions,
by contrast with continuous distributions like the bell curve.

* Also probability and statistical techniques are often used in data science.
The binary classification problem, of say classifying a tumor as
malignant or benign, uses a statistical modeling technique, called
regression, specifically logistic regression to determine the strength
of the relationship between the independent variable, and dependent
heterogeneity variable. In the tumor grading example the independent
variable would be $(x_1,x_2 )$ (elastic heterogeneity, nonlinear elasticity),
and the dependent variable would be $Y$, classified as $0$, or $1$,
 (malignant or benign).

=== Applications to Social Sciences

Discrete mathematical techniques are important in understanding  and
analyzing social networks including social media networks.

The mathematics of voting is a
thriving area of study, including mathematically analyzing
the gerrymandering of congressional districts to favor and/or
disfavor competing political parties.  The following example illustrates some of
the fundamental ideas related to gerrymandering.

****
.Example--Mathematics and Voting

Consider a fictitious state made up of $10$ congressional districts
with $7$ thousand voters in each district. To win a district a party
(Green or Blue) needs to win $4$ thousand or more votes.
Consider the following two districting map scenarios.
In each scenario, the blue party earns $28$ thousand votes, and
the green party earns $42$ thousand votes. In scenario $A$, the blue party
wins $2$ out of $10$ districts, but in scenario $B$ it wins $7$  out of $10$ districts.

== Understanding Continuous and Discrete Sets

Sets of objects are *discrete* if there is a _gap_ between each of the elements.
Informally we mean that the elements are _not
connected continuously_ so that there the values of the set elements do not
fall on a continuum.  Practically speaking, sets are discrete if they can be
counted.

[NOTE]
====
A finite set is always discrete, since it can be counted.
====

=== Examples of discrete sets

There are various types of discrete sets.



****

.Example--The discrete set of all real integers

The set of all real numbers is a continuous set, and cannot be counted (said to be uncountable).

By contrast the set of integers, both negative and positive,
$..., -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...$, is countable and discrete.

.The set of real integers

image::images/set_integers.png[]

****

//MKD - may omit the "The discrete set of rational numbers" example
// since per https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RationalNumber.html (need to get original ref), "It is always possible to find another rational number between any two members of the set of rationals. Therefore, rather counterintuitively, the rational numbers are a continuous set, but at the same time countable."
//****
//
//.Example--The discrete set of rational numbers
//
//The set of all fractions or rational numbers in
the interval $[0,1]$ is countable, by contrast, with the set of
all real numbers in the continuous interval, $[0,1]$, which is uncountable and also not
discrete.
//
//.The set of rational numbers in the interval, $[0,1]$.

.Example--All finite sets are discrete

As noted, any finite set is discrete. Examples include

.. The set of US states, $\{Alabama,Alaska,\ldots, Wyoming\}$

.. People, including the set $\{ \ all\ human\ beings\ on\ planet\ Earth \}$

.. Physical objects

.Example--Relations from one finite set to another

The set of all relations from one finite set to another finite set, is also finite and
discrete.

For example the set of all relations from the set $\{A, B \}$ to the set
$\{0, 1\}$, is the set $F$, of $9$ relations,

$F=\{R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5, R_6, R_7, R_8, R_9\}$:

.. $R_1=\{ (A,0), (B,0)\}$,
.. $R_2=\{ (A,0), (B,1)\}$,
.. $R_3=\{ (A,0), (B,0), (B,1)\}$,
.. $R_4=\{ (A,1), (B,0),  \}$,
.. $R_5=\{ (A,1),  (B,1)\}$,
.. $R_6=\{ (A,1),(B,0),  (B,1)\}$,
.. $R_7=\{ (A,0),(A,1),  (B,0)\}$,
.. $R_8=\{ (A,0),(A,1),  (B,1)\}$,
.. $R_9=\{ (A,0),(A,1),  (B,0), (B,1)\}$,

== Exercises
. Give the set of all relations from the set $\{A, B \}$ to the set,
$\{0, 1, 2\}$, and explain why the set is discrete.


. Consider rolling a six-sided die twice.  The possible outcomes are of the form $(2, 3)$, corresponding to rolling
a $2$, followed by rolling a $3$, or $(3,2)$, corresponding to rolling a $3$, followed by a $2$.
.. List all possible outcomes.
.. Explain why the set of all possible outcomes is a discrete set.
