# the '#' character makes a COMMENT separating Python from English
x = 3 # create the VARIABLE with NAME x and STORE INT VALUE 3
Sebastien_Score = 9001 # variable names can be long, but no spaces!

z = "Hi There!" # z stores a STRING value
w = False # w stores a BOOLEAN value

# Maths

# Boolean Operators

a = (True and False) # a stores False, AND returns True only when both sides are True
a = (True or False) # a stores True, OR returns True if at least 1 side is True
a = (not False) # a stores True, NOT returns opposite

# BLOCKS start with a ':' and continue with each INDENTED line

c = a[3] # c stores 90
d = a[-1] # -1 is last value, d stores 90

f = a + [5, 15] # f stores [10, 50, 20, 90, 5, 15], CONCATENATION not addition
g = range(0, 4) # range function returns list 0 up to 4, g stores [0, 1, 2, 3]

# For Loops
for c in "Elephant!": # repeat block with c storing each character 1 at a time
    print(c) # prints one letter per line

for x in [10, 30, 20]:
    print(x) # prints one number per line

# Custom Functions
def myfunc(a, b): # DEFINES a new function that takes 2 INPUT PARAMETER values
    c = 2 * a + b # executes only when function is called
    return c # RETURNS a value back to the calling code

x = myfunc(10, 5) # Calls the myfunc() function, x stores return value 25
y = myfunc(1, 3)  # Calls the myfunc() function, x stores return value 5
