Graphs are discrete mathematical structures that have many applications in a diversity of fields including chemistry, network analysis, algorithms, and social sciences.



== Introduction and Basic Definitions

//MKD rewrite of first paragraph
//A *graph* $G=\left(V,\ E\right)$ is a structure consisting of a set of objects called vertices $V$ and a set of objects called edges $E$. An *edge* $e\in\ E$ is a set of the form $e=\left\{x,y\right\}$, where $x,y\in\ V$. That is, an edge is a set of vertices. We call the vertices $x$ and $y$ the *endpoints* of the edge $E$. In the case where $x = y$, we call the edge a *loop* since the edge connects the one endpoint to itself.

A graph consists of a set of *vertices*  (also called *nodes*) and a set of *edges*, 
where each edge either 
connects two different vertices or
connects a vertex to itself. 

* For each edge, its *endpoints* are the vertices that it connects. The edge is said to be incident with each endpoint, and to connect the endpoints.
* If an edge has only one endpoint, it is called a *loop*. 
* An *isolated vertex* is a vertex that is not an endpoint of any edge.
* If two or more edges connect the same endpoints (or endpoint if the edges are loops), the graph is called a *multigraph*.
* A *simple graph* is a graph that has no loops and does not have two or more edges that connect the same endpoints.
//If there are no loops and no two edges connect the same endpoints, the graph is called *simple.* 

Graphs discussed in this textbook are assumed to be simple unless stated otherwise.

****
.Example {counter:graphex} 
//- A multigraph that contains a loop and an isolated point
//- An undirected graph.

//The graph shown has vertex set $\left\{A,\ B,\ C,\ D,\ E,\ F\right\}$ and 
//edge set $\{\{A,C\},\{D\},\{B,D\}\{B,F\},\{D,F\}\}.$ 

The graph shown has 7 vertices 
// set $\left\{A,\ B,\ C,\ D,\ E,\ F\right\}$ 
and 7 edges.
// set $\{\{A,C\},\{D\},\{B,D\}\{B,F\},\{D,F\}\}.$ 

image::imagesMKD/graphMKD1.png[]
//image::imagesMKD/graph1withAddedLoopAndComponents_MultigraphVersion.png[]
//image::imagesMKD/graph1withAddedLoopAndComponents.png[]
//image::images/graph1.png[]

This is _one graph_ that is made up of three separate _connected components_ (Connectivity will be defined in detail later in the chapter, but is introduced informally here). 

* One connected component contains the vertices $A$ and $C$ and two edges that connect them.  
* A second connected component contains the vertices $B$, $D$, $E$, and $F$ and the edges that are incident to those vertices. 
* A third connected component contains the single isolated vertex $G$ and no edges.
 
In the second connected component, 
the graph is drawn so that 
the edge with endpoints $B$ and $F$ and 
the edge with endpoints $D$ and $E$ 
cross, but the point of intersection is ignored 
because it is not a vertex. 
//We could redraw this graph with $E$ to the left of $D$ so that the two edges do not cross; 
We could redraw this graph so that the two edges do not cross; for example, we could move $E$ inside the triangle. 
However, there are some graphs which cannot be drawn in 2 dimensions without some edge crossings.

This graph is a multigraph because there are multiple edges that connect the pair of vertices $\{A,C\}$.

This graph is not simple because (1) it contains a loop and (2) it has a pair of vertices that are connected by two different edges.


****



MORE TO COME!
////


//We will define simple graphs formally using set theory 
//which is done 
//after the next example, but we will usually represent graphs using a 
//"connect-the-dots" style 
It is possible to write a formal definition of graphs in terms of set theory, but it is common to use a drawing as in the preceding example when there are small numbers of vertices and edges. 

// MKD define digraphs in separate section

== Simple Graphs



// MKD - probably need to keep this formal definition

Here is a formal definition of simple graph: 
The formal definition of 
//simple graphs 
may be useful to you if you need to implement a simple graph in code.

A *simple graph* $G=\left(V,\ E\right)$ is an ordered pair consisting of a set $V$ of objects called *vertices* (or *nodes*) and a set $E$ of objects called *edges*.
// MKD need to update to say that edges can be any of 
// an unordered pair, a singleton, or an ordered pair. 
An edge $e\in\ E$ is a set of the form $e=\left\{x,y\right\}$, where the vertices $x$ and $y$ are two different elements of $V$. The two vertices $x$ and $y$ in the edge $e=\left\{x,y\right\}$ are said to be *adjacent* or *connected*, and $x$ and $y$ are called the *endpoints* of $e$. 
// MKD no loops in simple graphs.
//If the two vertices of an edge are the same, that is, $e=\left\{x,y\right\}$, then the edge $e$ is called a *loop*.  

//The graph in the previous example has vertex set 
//$\left\{A,\ B,\ C,\ D,\ E,\ F\right\}$ and 
//edge set
//$\{\{A,C\},\{D\},\{B,D\}\{B,F\},\{D,F\}\}.$ Note that the graph is not a //simple graph because there is a loop that has endpoint $D$.


****
.Example {counter:graphex} - an undirected graph.

The graph shown has vertex set $V=\left\{A,\ B,\ C,\ D,\ E,\ F\right\}$ and edge set
$E=\{\{A,C\},\{A,D\},\{B,D\}\{B,F\},\{C,F\},\{D,F\},\{F,E\}\}$

=== Directed Graphs

A *directed graph* (or *digraph*) is 
//an extension of the definition of 
a graph in which the edges are directed from one vertex to another vertex.


****
.Example {counter:graphex} - A directed graph.

The graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertex set 
$V=\{A,B,C,D,E,F\}$  and 
edge set
$E=\{ (A,C),(D,A),(B,D),(F,B),(C,F),(D,F),(F,E) \}$. 
The first coordinate of each edge is the initial vertex and the second coordinate is the terminal vertex.

image::images/graph2.png[]

****

The *degree* of a vertex $v \in V$, denoted $d(v)$, is the number of edges in the graph $G$
containing the vertex $v$.

****
.Example {counter:graphex}

The degrees of each of the vertices in the undirected graph $G$  with vertex set
$V=\{A,B,C,D,E,F,G\}$ and edge set $E=\{\{A,C\},\{A,D\},\{B,D\}\{B,F\},\{C,F\},\{D,F\},\{F,G\}$
are,

$d\left(A\right)=2$

$d\left(B\right)=2$

$d\left(C\right)=2$

$d\left(D\right)=3$

$d\left(E\right)=0$

$d\left(F\right)=4$

$d\left(G\right)=1$

****

Notice that the total sum of all the degrees
$d\left(A\right)+\ d\left(B\right)\ +\ d\left(C\right)+\ \ d\left(D\right)\ \ +d\left(E\right)+\ d\left(F\right) + d\left(G\right)=14$
is twice the number of edges $\left|E\right|=7$ in the graph.
This is true in general and we state this result as  theorem, often called the handshaking lemma.


.Handshaking Lemma
****
The sum of the degrees of the vertices of a graph $G=\left(V,\ E\right)$ is equal to twice the number of edges
in $G$. That is, $\displaystyle \sum_{v\in V}{d\left(v\right)=2\ \left|E\right|}$.
****

[NOTE]
====
A useful consequence of this to keep in mind is that the sum of the degrees of a graph is always even.

== Representing graphs.

In addition to the vertex-edge representation of graphs there are alternative ways to represent a
graph, especially useful for computing.

=== The Adjacency Matrix
One way is the use of an adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix $M$ represents a graph in a
table form, containing a row and column for each vertex $v_i$. If the vertices
$v_i$ and $v_j$ are connected by an edge
$e$, the adjacency matrix will contain a $1$ in the $i-th$ row and $j-th$ column and $0$ otherwise.
Denoting by $m_{i,\ j}$ the component of the adjacency matrix in the $i-th$ row and $j-th$ column,
we define the adjacency matrix for the graph $G=\left(V,E\right)$ as

latexmath:[
m_{i,j}=\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
 1 & \text{if}\text{  }\left\{v_i,v_j\right\} \text{is}\text{  }\text{in}\text{  }E\text{  } \\
 0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right.
]

****
.Example {counter:graphex} - adjacency matrix of a graph

The graph with  vertex set $V=\left\{A,\ B,\ C,\ D,\ E,\ F\right\}$ and edge
set
$E=\{\{A,C\},\{A,D\},\{B,D\}\{B,F\},\{C,F\},\{D,F\},\{F,E\}\}$ has adjacency matrix

\begin{matrix}A&0&1&1&0&0&0\\C&1&0&0&0&1&0\\D&1&0&0&1&1&0\\B&0&0&1&0&1&0\\F&0&1&1&1&0&1\\E&0&0&0&0&1&0\\\ &A&C&D&B&F&E\\\end{matrix}

****

****
.Example {counter:graphex} - obtaining the graph from the adjacency matrix

The graph with adjacency matrix

\begin{matrix}a&0&1&1&1\\c&1&0&1&1\\d&1&1&0&1\\b&1&1&1&0\\\ &a&c&d&b\\\end{matrix}

is the graph shown below.

image::images/graph3.png[]

****

=== The Adjacency Matrix for Directed Graphs

Undirected graphs are represented using symmetric adjacency matrices while digraphs are represented by adjacency matrices that are not symmetric.

****
.Example {counter:graphex} - adjacency matrices for an undirected graph and for a directed graph

In the figure below the first graph is undirected while the second is a digraph.

image::images/graph4.png[]


Their adjacency matrices are respectively,



latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}0&1&1&0\\1&0&1&0\\1&1&0&0\\0&0&0&0\\\end{matrix}\right)
]
 and
latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}0&1&0&0\\0&0&1&0\\1&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0\\\end{matrix}\right).
]

****

== Weighted Graphs

A *weighted graph* is one in which each edge $e$ is assigned a nonnegative number $w(e)$,
called the weight of that edge. Weights are typically associated with costs, or capacities of
some type like distance or speed.  The adjacency matrices for weighted graphs are very
similar to those for graphs that are not necessarily weighted. Instead of using a $1$ to
represent an edge between two vertices, say $v_i$, and $v_j$, we place the the weight of the edge
$w(e)$ in position $m_{i,j}$ of the adjacency matrix as shown in the following two examples.

****
.Example {counter:graphex}
Consider first the following weighted undirected graph

image::images/graph5.png[]

Its adjacency matrix is
latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}0&2&5&0\\2&0&3&0\\5&3&0&1\\0&0&1&0\\\end{matrix}\right).
]

By contrast, the directed weighted graph below

image::images/graph6.png[]

has adjacency matrix
latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}0&2&0&0\\0&0&3&0\\5&0&0&1\\0&0&0&0\\\end{matrix}\right).
]
****

== Subgraphs

A graph $H=(V_1,E_1)$ is said to be a *subgraph* of the graph $G=(V,\ E)$ if
$V_1\subseteq V$ and $E_1\subseteq E$.


If the vertex $v\in V$ belongs to the graph  $G=(V,E)$, we denote by *$G-v$*,
the subgraph obtained from G by removing the vertex $v$ and all edges in $E$
adjacent to the vertex $v$.

Below is shown a graph $G$, and the subgraph $G-d$ formed by removing the vertex $d$.

image::images/graph7.png[]


A natural generalization of the subgraph obtained by removing a vertex is the subgraph
obtained by removing multiple vertices and the  edges associated with the removed vertices. The subgraph obtained is called the subgraph *induced* by removing those vertices.

****
.Example {counter:graphex}
Below is a graph $G(V,E)$ and the subgraph obtained by $V-\{a,d\}$, called the induced subgraph
$G-\{a,d\}$, with a slight abuse of notation

image::images/graph8.png[]
****

== Connectivity, Eulerian Graphs, and Hamiltonian Graphs
A *walk* on a graph $G=\left(V,E\right)$ is a finite, non-empty, alternating sequence of
vertices and edges of the form, $v_0e_1v_1e_2\ldots e_nv_n$, with vertices $v_i\in V$ and edges $e_i\in E$.

A *trail* is a walk that does not repeat an edge, ie. all edges are distinct.

A *path* is a trail that does not repeat a vertex.

The *distance* between two vertices, $u$ and $v$, denoted $d(u,v)$, is the number of
edges in a shortest path connecting them.

A *cycle* is a non-empty trail in which the only repeating vertices are the beginning and
ending vertices, $v_0=v_n$.

In the graphs below the first shows a trail $CFDBFE$.
It is not a path since the vertex $F$ is repeated.
The second shows a path $CADFB$, and the third a cycle $CADFC$. Also note the following
distances, $d(A,D)=1$, while $d(A,F)=2$, and $d(A,E)=3$.

image::images/graph9.png[]

A graph is *connected* if there is a path from each vertex to every other vertex.

The graph below is not connected,

image::images/graph10.png[]

and has adjacency matrix,

latexmath:[
\left(\begin{matrix}0&1&1&0&0\\1&0&1&0&0\\1&1&0&0&0\\0&0&0&0&1\\0&0&0&1&0\\\end{matrix}\right).
]



=== Eulerian Graphs

Informally an  *Eulerian graph* is one in which there is a closed (beginning and ending with the
same vertex) trail that includes all edges. To define this precisely, we use the idea of an Eulerian trail.

An *Eulerian trail* or *Eulerian circuit* is a closed trail containing each edge of the
graph  $G=(V,\ G)$ exactly once and returning to the start vertex. A graph with an
Eulerian trail is considered *Eulerian* or is said to be an *Eulerian graph*.

In the following, the first graph is Eulerian with the Eulerian circuit sequenced from $1$ to $7$.
The second is not an Eulerian graph. Convince yourself of this fact by  looking at all
necessary trails or closed trails.

image::images/graph11.png[]

An *Euler path* on a graph is a path that uses each edge of the graph exactly once. The following are useful
characterizations of graphs with Euler circuits and Euler paths and are due to Leonhard Euler

.Theorem on Euler Circuits and Euler Paths

****
.. A finite connected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if each vertex has even degree.
.. A finite connected graph has an Euler path if and only if it has most two vertices with odd degree.
****

=== Hamiltonian Graphs

A cycle in a graph $G=\left(V,E\right)$, is said to be a *Hamiltonian cycle* if every vertex,
except for the starting and ending vertex in $V$, is visited exactly once.

A graph is *Hamiltonian*, or said to be a *Hamiltonian graph*, if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle.


The following graph is Hamiltonian and shows a Hamiltonian cycle $ABCDA$, highlighted, while
the second graph is not Hamiltonian.

image::images/graph12.png[]




While we have the Euler Theorem to tell us which graphs are Eulerian or not, there are no
comparable simple criteria to determine if graphs are Hamiltonian or not. We do have the following sufficient
criterion due to Paul Dirac.

.Theorem (Dirac) on Hamiltonian graphs
****
A simple graph, with $n≥3$ vertices, is Hamiltonian if every vertex $v$ has degree $d(v)\geq \frac{n}{2}$.

so that every edge $e\in E$ joins two vertices, with one vertex in $M$ and
the other in $N$. One way to think of bipartite graphs is to partition
the vertices by two colors, say black and white, and every edge connects a
black vertex with a white vertex (never connecting two vertices of the same color).

. A *spanning tree* on a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is a subgraph of
$G$ with $n-1$ edges that form a tree. For a weighted graph, the *minimum spanning
tree* is a spanning tree with minimum total edge weights. *Kruskal’s algorithm* is a
procedure that finds the minimum spanning tree for a weighted graph. It sorts the
edges in nondecreasing order by weight and then builds the minimum spanning tree,
beginning just with the vertices (technically called a forest), and then successively
adding edges of nondecreasing weights that do not form cycles.
Formally the Kruskal
algorithm is,
+
(1) Choose an edge with minimum weight and add it to the tree provided it does not
	create a cycle.
+
(2) Choose an edge with minimum weight and add it to the tree provided it does not
	create a cycle.
+
(3) Repeat step (2) until $n-1$ edges are added to create a spanning tree of $n-1$ edges.
+
Apply Kruskal's algorithm to the following graphs.
