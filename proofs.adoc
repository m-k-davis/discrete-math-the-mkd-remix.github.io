Recall from the chapter on Logic that an *argument* is a finite sequence of statements that ends with a final statement, the *conclusion*, that is based on inferences made from the earlier statements, called *premises*.

An argument is *valid* if it is of a form such that if all premises are True then the conclusion must be True, too. An argument is not valid just because it exists! Compare this situation to a proposition, which is a single statement that may be either True or False (but not both); an argument is a finite sequence of statements that may be either valid or invalid.

A *proof* is a valid argument made up of propositions. In a proof, some premises may be *axioms* or *postulates*, which are propositions that we simply ASSUME to be True. Other premises used in a proof may be previously-proven propositions called *theorems*. There are many other terms used for theorems depending on the context, such as *lemma* (a minor theorem needed to prove a more important major theorem) and *corollary* (a theorem that is a conclusion based on a premise that is a more important theorem), 
//etc., 
but each of these specialized terms describes a theorem.

//You will see later in this chapter that in many proofs, we ASSUME that some premises are True and may prove other premises along the way before reaching the final conclusion.

== Rules Of Inference

//MKD need to define an argument somewhere (or already in Logic chapter?)
//MKD - can recycle the Sarah and Daniel example from Logic chapter, but write in the form 
// $p$
// $p \rightarrow q$
// vertical line
// \therefore q


//In order to make a valid argument, we must 
To create a proof, we must 
//allow ourselves to 
proceed from True propositions to other True propositions without introducing False propositions into the argument. 
//using invalid reasoning. 
//To this end, 
To do this, we use *rules of inference*, which are ways to draw a True conclusion from one or more premises that are already known to be True (or assumed to be True). That is, a *rule of inference* is an argument form that corresponds to a tautology, and so is valid. 
//This is most easily explained by example.

//One source of rules of inference are tautologies as discussed in the chapter on Logic.

.Example {counter:proofexample} - Notation For A Rule Of Inference

A rule of inference can be represented as 
follows.
// an argument of the form

[no-bullet]
* $p_{1}$
* $p_{2}$
* $\vdots$
* $p_{n}$
//* $____$
* $\therefore q$

The propositional variables $p_{1},\,p_{2},\,\ldots,\,p_{n}$ represent the premises of the argument, and $q$ represents the conclusion of the argument. The symbol $\therefore$ is read as "therefore".

This rule of inference is interpreted to mean that if all of the propositions $p_{1},\,p_{2},\,\ldots,\,p_{n}$ are True then the proposition $q$ MUST be True.
//, too.
//Each 
//That is, this 
The rule of inference 
in this example 
corresponds to 
//an established 
the tautology 
//of the form 
$(p_{1} \land p_{2} \land \ldots \land p_{n})\rightarrow q$.
//These rules of inference can be used in any mathematical argument and do not require any proof.

Note that the conclusion $q$ must be the last proposition, but 
//that, technically, 
the order in which the premises  $p_{1},\,p_{2},\,\ldots,\,p_{n}$ are listed in the argument does not matter since we use the conjunction of all premises to prove the conclusion. 
The premises $p_{1},\,p_{2},\,\ldots,\,p_{n}$ are usually presented in an order that follows the flow of thought.

.Example {counter:proofexample} - Valid and Invalid Arguments
//MKD inserted this example 2/17/24; refers back to Logic chapter

Consider the following three arguments.

.A Valid Argument

The following argument was used as an example in the Logic chapter. 

[no-bullet]
* Sarah earned a B.S. in Computer Science.
//* Anyone who earned a B.S. in Computer Science earned a C or better in Discrete Math.
* Anyone who earned a B.S. in Computer Science must have earned a C or better in Discrete Math.
* Therefore, Sarah earned a C or better in Discrete Math.

//This 
The argument is of the form

//[no-bullet]
//* Individual X is a member of category A
//* Any individual that is a member of category A must also be a member of category B.
//* Therefore, individual X is a member of category B

//or 

[no-bullet]
* _p_
* if _p_ then _q_
* $\therefore$ _q_ 


This argument form is named *_modus ponens_*, which is translated roughly from Latin as "method of affirming". 
_Modus ponens_ is a *valid* argument form because it corresponds to the  tautology $(p \land (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow q$. 

[width=50%",align="center",options="header"]
|====
| $p$ | $q$ | $p \rightarrow q$ | $p \land (p \rightarrow q)$ | $q$ | $(p \land (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow q$
| T | T | T | T | T | T
| T | F | F | F | F | T
| F | T | T | F | T | T
| F | F | T | F | F | T
|====

//Such an arugment form is called a *rule of inference*.
That is, _modus ponens_ is a rule of inference.

.An Invalid Argument
//Compare the above argument to the following one.
Consider this second argument.

[no-bullet]
* Arya earned a C or better in Discrete Math.
//* Anyone who earned a B.S. in Computer Science earned a C or better in Discrete Math.
* Anyone who earned a B.S. in Computer Science must have earned a C or better in Discrete Math.
* Therefore, Arya earned a B.S. in Computer Science.

//Hopefully, it does not surprise you that this 
This argument is NOT valid. 
//If we know that Arya earned a C or better in Discrete Math, 
If we assume that 
//all premises, which are 
the first two propositions
//, 
are True, we do not have enough information to reach the conclusion 
that Arya earned a B.S. in Computer Science: 
// that Arya earned a B.S. in Computer Science: Arya 
Arya _may_ have earned that degree, but _may_ still be working towards the degree, or _may_ have changed majors and 
//graduated after earning 
earned a degree in the new major, or perhaps there is some other possibility -  we cannot determine 
//the truth value of 
whether the conclusion 
is True or False 
//by assuming that 
based on the assumption that 
the two premises are True.

The argument 
//about Arya 
//is invalid because it 
corresponds to the 
//invalid 
argument form

[no-bullet]
* _q_
* if _p_ then _q_
* $\therefore$ _p_ 

This argument form is an example of a *fallacy* or *_non sequitur_*, which is Latin for "it does not follow". 
//This 
The argument form is *invalid* 
//and is  
//called a *fallacy* (or *non sequitur*, Latin for "it does not follow").
//. The argument form 
//because it 
//is invalid - 
because it 
//does NOT 
corresponds to a 
proposition that is NOT a 
tautology, 
as can be seen in the truth table for the compound proposition 
$(q \land (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow p$. 



[width=50%",align="center",options="header"]
|====
| $p$ | $q$ | $p \rightarrow q$ | $q \land (p \rightarrow q)$ | $p$ | $(q \land (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow p$
| T | T | T | T | T | T
| T | F | F | F | T | T
| #F# | #T# | #T# | #T# | #F# | #F#
| F | F | T | F | F | T
|====

//That is, we can not infer $p$ from $q \land (p \rightarrow q)$ because both

Notice that there is at least one row of the truth table in which both $q$ and $p \rightarrow q$ are True but $p$ is False! This means that we can NOT infer that $p$ is True whenever $(q \land (p \rightarrow q))$ is True. The argument form is *invalid* because $(q \land (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow p$ is not a tautology. 

This particular fallacy is used so often that it has its own name: The *converse error*, or *fallacy of the converse*.

.A Third Argument - You Try
//Compare the above argument to the following one.

Write the argument form for the following argument. 

[no-bullet]
* Ping did not earn a B.S. in Computer Science.
//* Anyone who earned a B.S. in Computer Science earned a C or better in Discrete Math.
* Anyone who earned a B.S. in Computer Science must have earned a C or better in Discrete Math.
* Therefore, Ping did not earn a C or better in Discrete Math.

Find a compound proposition that corresponds to the argument form you wrote, and write the truth table for that compound proposition.

[env.question]
--
Is the argument valid? 
--

[click.hint]
--
The argument is valid if and only if the compound proposition is a tautology.
--

[click.answer]
--
No. The argument is invalid and is an example of the *inverse error* or *fallacy of the inverse*.

****

In the following subsections we will discuss some of the more common rules of inference.

=== Transitivity Of The Conditional

The following rule of inference is called *pure hypothetical syllogism,* but we will use the less formal name *transitivity.* It is the basis of conditional proof in mathematics.

.Transitivity (Pure Hypothetical Syllogism)
****
[no-bullet]
* $p \rightarrow q$
* $q \rightarrow r$
* $\therefore p \rightarrow r$ 

This rule of inference corresponds to the tautology 
$((p \rightarrow q) \land (q \rightarrow r)) \rightarrow (p \rightarrow r)$.
****

By applying transitivity multiple times, we can build a finite chain of implications of any length we want: 
[no-bullet]
* $p \rightarrow p_{1}$
* $p_{1} \rightarrow p_{2}$
* $p_{2} \rightarrow p_{3}$
* $\vdots$
* $p_{k-1} \rightarrow p_{k}$
* $p_{k} \rightarrow r$
* $\therefore p \rightarrow r$ 


//=== More on Modus Ponens, et al.
=== Rules Of Inference And Fallacies Arising From The Conditional

Recall that if we have propositions _p_ and _q_, we can form the conditional with *hypothesis* $p$ and *consequent* $q$, written as $p \rightarrow q$, as well as three other related 
//compound propositions that are also 
conditionals.

* $p \rightarrow q$, the conditional
* $q \rightarrow p$, the converse of $p \rightarrow q$  
* $\neg q \rightarrow \neg p$, the contrapositive of $p \rightarrow q$
* $\neg p \rightarrow \neg q$, the inverse of $p \rightarrow q$ 

Also, recall that $(p \rightarrow q) \equiv (\neg q \rightarrow \neg p)$. That is, $(p \rightarrow q) \leftrightarrow (\neg q \rightarrow \neg p)$ is a tautology. This means that the conditional is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. The conditional is NOT logically equivalent to either its converse or its inverse, as was shown using truth tables in the Logic chapter.

From the four conditionals we get two rules of inference and two fallacies. 
Together, these four argument forms are referred to as the 
*mixed hypothetical syllogisms.*
//, a term unlikely to be used again in this textbook.
//, but mentioned here so that you can say honestly "I remember seeing that somewhere once!"

First, here are the two rules of inference.

.Modus Ponens ("Method Of Affirming")
****
[no-bullet]
* $p \rightarrow q$
* $p$
* $\therefore q$ 

This rule of inference corresponds to the tautology 
$((p \rightarrow q) \land p) \rightarrow q$.
//, a valid use of the conditional $p \rightarrow q$.
****

.Modus Tollens ("Method Of Denying")
****
[no-bullet]
* $p \rightarrow q$
* $\neg q$
* $\therefore \neg p$ 

This rule of inference corresponds to the tautology 
$((p \rightarrow q) \land \neg q) \rightarrow \neg p$. 

This rule of inference corresponds to replacing the conditional 
$p \rightarrow q$ by its logically equivalent contrapositive $\neg q \rightarrow \neg p$.
****

Next, here are the two fallacies. They are included because they are very common errors to be aware of and to avoid. 
[WARNING]
//[CAUTION]
====
//These are NOT rules of inference: They don't work!
//DO NOT USE THESE FOR INFERENCE - THEY DON'T WORK!!!

.Inverse Error
// - Do Not Use!
// For Inference
****
[no-bullet]
* $p \rightarrow q$
* $\neg p$
//* [line-through]#$\therefore \neg q$# 
* [line-through]#∴¬_q_#

This fallacy arises by mistakenly treating the inverse $\neg p \rightarrow \neg q$ as if it were logically equivalent to $p \rightarrow q$. It is also called the "fallacy of the inverse" and "fallacy of denying the hypothesis". 
****
====
[WARNING]
//[CAUTION]
====

.Converse Error
// - Do Not Use!
// For Inference
****
[no-bullet]
* $p \rightarrow q$
* $q$
//* $\therefore p$
* [line-through]#∴_p_#

This fallacy arises by mistakenly treating the converse $q \rightarrow p$ as if it were logically equivalent to $p \rightarrow q$. It is also called the "fallacy of the converse" and the "fallacy of affirming the consequent".
****
====

The following image uses an *Euler diagram* of two sets $A \subseteq B$ to explain why the converse error is a fallacy. The image can also be used to explain why the inverse error is a fallacy.
//If $x \in B$, then we cannot determine whether $x \in A$ or $x \notin A$.

image::imagesMKD/ConverseErrorForSets.png[]

Suppose you were told that $c$ is an element of $B$ in the preceding image. Can you determine whether $c$ is an element of $A$, too?


=== Other Common Rules Of Inference

Any tautology of the form $p \rightarrow q$
//$(p_{1} \land p_{2} \land \ldots \land p_{n})\rightarrow q$ 
can be used to define a rule of inference. 
In particular, we can define a rule of inference corresponding to the tautology $(p_{1} \land p_{2} \land \ldots \land p_{n})\rightarrow p_{1}$ for each integer $n \geq 1$.  
//In the Logic chapter, an algorithm was described that lets you rewrite any compound proposition as a logically equivalent disjunctive normal form (DNF). Given a conditional of the form $p \rightarrow q$, $p$ can be replaced by a logically equivalent DNF. 
//In the discussion above about transitivity, it was stated that .
This means that there are at least as many possible tautologies as there are natural numbers! How do we deal with infinitely many tautologies?

In general, there is a small number of rules of inference that are used in most proofs. Proofs often are built up to a large size by applying just a few rules of inference multiple times.

Here are some of the more commonly-used rules of inference. In the remix author's opinion, it's better to practice _using_ these rules of inference rather than to focus on memorizing them as formal rules with special names.


.Proof by Cases
****
[no-bullet]
* $p \rightarrow r$
* $q \rightarrow r$
* $p \lor q$
* $\therefore r$
//(p \lor q) \rightarrow r$ 

This rule of inference corresponds to the tautology 
$((p \rightarrow q) \land (q \rightarrow r) \land (p \lor q)) \rightarrow r$.
****


.Resolution
****
[no-bullet]
* $p \rightarrow q$
* $\neg p \rightarrow r$
* $\therefore q \lor r$ 

This rule of inference corresponds to the tautology 
$((p \rightarrow q) \land (\neg p \rightarrow r)) \rightarrow (q \lor r)$.
****


.Elimination
****
[no-bullet]
* $p \lor q$
* $\neg q$
* $\therefore p$ 

This rule of inference corresponds to the tautology 
$((p \lor q) \land \neg q) \rightarrow p$.
****

.Contradiction Rule
****
[no-bullet]
* $\neg p \rightarrow (q \land \neg q)$
* $\therefore p$ 

This rule of inference corresponds to the tautology 
$(\neg p \rightarrow (q \land \neg q)) \rightarrow p$.

Note that this tautology is 
//logically equivalent to 
often written in the alternate form 
$((\neg p \rightarrow q) \land (\neg p \rightarrow \neg q)) \rightarrow p$, which 
//is sometimes 
can be more useful in some contexts.
****

//MKD get list of rules of inference from the the TWTask "Logic" and have students verify using truth tables.
//MKD Also see table of rules of inference in Rosen, p 68
//MKD Also see table of rules of inference with quantifiers in Rosen, p 76


There are [underline]#many# more rules of inference we could 
//(but won't) 
write down and give names to. Instead, we'll just list a few tautologies.
//.. As an exercise, try to figure out 

****
.You Try
For each of the tautologies shown, write the argument form for the corresponding rule of inference. If needed, refer to Example 2 in this chapter to see how the argument, argument form, and tautology are related.

* $(p \land q) \rightarrow p$
* $p \rightarrow (p \lor q)$
* $p \rightarrow (q \rightarrow (p \land q))$

== Proof Techniques - SECTION IN PROGRESS

In this section we will give several examples of formal mathematical proofs to illustrate different techniques.

Each proof starts with us stating a *conjecture*, which is a proposition with undetermined truth value. The goal of each proof is to determine the truth value of the relevant conjecture.

To simplify the description of the proof techniques, we'll only consider the case where the proof has a _single premise_ $p$, that is, we'll always assume that our proof  
//is of the _modus ponens_ form $(p \land (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow q$. 
involves a single conditional $p \rightarrow q$. This may seem like an oversimplification, but it is not: We are simply renaming the conjunction $(p_{1} \land p_{2} \land \ldots \land p_{n})$ of the actual premises by using the single propositional variable $p$, that is we are _defining_ $p$ by the logical equivalence $p \equiv (p_{1} \land p_{2} \land \ldots \land p_{n})$


MORE TO COME!!

////
The phrase *"without loss of generality"* is often used in a proof in order to take a shortcut. For example, suppose we want to prove a conjecture involving a positive rational number of the form $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are nonzero integers. It may be convenient to assume that the fraction has been reduced so that $a$ and $b$ have no common prime factors, but that may not be one of the premises. However, we know from experience that we have a method for finding a greatest common divisor for $a$ and $b$ that would allow us to replacing those numbers in the fraction with ones that have no common prime factors... so instead of proving that we can reduce the fraction we just state "without loss of generality, assume that $a$ and $b$ have no common prime factor".


=== Direct Proof

In a direct proof, we start 
//with one or more premises and use inference to arrive at the conclusion.
by assuming the premise $p$ and prove that $p \rightarrow q$, from which we can conclude $q$.

****
.Example {counter:proofexample} - Direct Proof

*Theorem:* For all integers $k$ and $m$, if $k$ or $m$ is even, then $km$ is even.

*Proof:* The formalization of the statement is 
\[(\forall k \in \mathbb{Z})(\forall m \in \mathbb{Z})( ((2 \text{ is a divisor of } k) \lor (2 \text{ is a divisor of } m)) \rightarrow (2 \text{ is a divisor of } km)  )\]

****


*Theorem:* For all integers $k$ and $m$, if both $k$ and $m$ are odd then $km$ is odd.

=== Proofs Using Multiple Cases

In some cases, it is convenient to break 
// one of the premises 
the single premise $p$ up into a new logically equivalent disjunction $r_{1} \lor r_{2} \lor \ldots \lor r_{n}$, then prove 
//the same conclusion $q$ using each of the $r_{k}$ propositions. That is, //we find $p_{1} \lor $p_{2} \lor \ldots \lor $p_{n} \equiv p$ then prove 
each of $r_{1} \rightarrow q$, $r_{2} \rightarrow q$, ..., $r_{n} \rightarrow q$, and apply the "proof by cases" rule of inference multiple times to infer that $p \rightarrow q$,  

*Theorem:* For all integers $n$, $n(n+1)$ is even.

*Proof:* Consider the cases "n is odd" and "n is even" separately

=== Proof By Contraposition (Indirect Proof)

In a proof by contraposition, we use the logical equivalence $(\neg q \rightarrow \neg p) \equiv (p \rightarrow q)$ to make the proof easier.

*Theorem:* For all integers $n$, if $n^{2}$ is odd, then $n$ is odd.

*Theorem:* For all integers $n$, if $n^{2}$ is even, then $n$ is even.

=== Proof By Contradiction

In a proof by contradiction, we prove that assuming the negation of the conclusion of the argument leads to a contradiction, that is we prove 
$(p_{1} \land p_{2} \land \ldots \land p_{n}) \land \neg q \rightarrow (r \land \neg r)$ for some proposition $r$, which implies that $(p_{1} \land p_{2} \land \ldots \land p_{n}) \land \neg q$ is False, which in turn implies $(p_{1} \land p_{2} \land \ldots \land p_{n}) \rightarrow q$.

*Theorem:* $\sqrt(2)$ is an irrational number.

*Proof:* Assume that $\sqrt(2)$ is rational and obtain a contradiction.

=== Refuting A Conjecture With A Counterexample

If we suspect that a conjecture is False, we can try to find a *counterexample* to disprove the conjecture.

*Conjecture:* Every natural number is the sum of three perfect square natural numbers.

This conjecture is a proposition that can be written more explicitly as "For all natural numbers $n$, there exist natural numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $n = a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2}$" or in formal symbolism as 
$(\forall n \in \mathbb{N})(\exists a \in \mathbb{N})(\exists b \in \mathbb{N})(\exists c \in \mathbb{N})(n = a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2})$. Let us try to refute this conjecture by showing that its negation is True. 
The negation is $(\exists n \in \mathbb{N})(\forall a \in \mathbb{N})(\forall b \in \mathbb{N})(\forall c \in \mathbb{N})(n \neq a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2})$. We can now do an exhaustive search for our counterexample. Without loss of generality, we can assume $a \geq b \geq c$ since we could always reorder and rename the three numbers that wil be squared.
\[0 = 0^{2} + 0^{2} + 0^{2}\]
\[1 = 1^{2} + 0^{2} + 0^{2}\]
\[2 = 1^{2} + 1^{2} + 0^{2}\]
\[3 = 1^{2} + 1^{2} + 1^{2}\]
\[4 = 2^{2} + 0^{2} + 0^{2}\]
\[5 = 2^{2} + 1^{2} + 0^{2}\]
\[6 = 2^{2} + 1^{2} + 1^{2}\]
\[8 = 2^{2} + 2^{2} + 0^{2}\]

Notice that we cannot write $7$ as a sum of three perfect square natural numbers: After $6 = 2^{2} + 1^{2} + 1^{2}$, the least sum of three perfect square natural numbers we can write is $8 = 2^{2} + 2^{2} + 0^{2}$. 
Therefore, there exists at least one $n \in \mathbb{N}$, namely 7, such that for all choices of natural numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$, $n \neq a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2}$. This refutes the conjecture and proves its negation.

*Theorem:* There exists a natural number that is not equal to the sum of three perfect square natural numbers.

You may be surprised to learn that the proposition "every natural number is the sum of [underline]#four# perfect square natural numbers" is True! This proposition is called _Lagrange's four-square theorem_, and its proof is  beyond the scope of this textbook.
